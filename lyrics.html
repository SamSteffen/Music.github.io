    <p>Hey ma, wake up it’s me, it’s your boy, Tom Joad<br>
    I’d love to but I can’t stay long, I’ve gotta hit the road<br>
    In the morning they’ll be lookin for me high up and down low<br>
    Cops from every county from Salinas to Frisco</p>
    
    <p>But I only got a minute here so I won’t make this long<br>
    I ain’t always done the right thing, hell, sometimes I been wrong<br>
    But as long as I am gonna be an outlaw from now on<br>
    Wherever there’s a stone unturned, hereby, I swear—</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        Wherever you can go to think some lonesome thought<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>
    
    <p>I’m ingredient to humankind, a partial to the whole<br>
    Tho I walk upon the stage of life I play a minor role<br>
    I am portion to the giant universal human soul<br>
    Which exists within everybody everywhere</p>
    
    <p>So I’ll be there when you’re weary, when you’re lonesome and afraid<br>
    When the delivery of all that you’ve been promised aint been made<br>
    When there ain’t no superhero to come rushin to your aid<br>
    When you got everything to lose and no time to spare</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        When the road becomes too narrow and the wilderness too broad<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>
    
    <p>I will be in every crevice of this bright world that’s gone dark<br>
    I will be in every desperate hallow achin broken heart<br>
    Long after its all over and well before it starts<br>
    Anyplace that folks can’t go or just don’t dare</p>
    
    <p>Wherever there’s a stranger sayin I’m too young to die<br>
    Wherever there’s a prayer that’s bein prayed up to the sky<br>
    Wherever there’s an angry cop just beatin up some guy<br>
    And the fight just don’t seem justified nor fair</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        So the one’s that go unseen unheard won’t be forgot<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>
    
    <p>Wherever fights’re brewin up so that hungry folks can eat<br>
    Wherever there’s a cry for revolution in the street<br>
    Wherever there’s a stranger who ain’t marchin to the beat<br>
    Who repels his last companion as he draws a stare</p>
    
    <p>In the way that guys start yelling when they’re stark raving mad<br>
    In the sighin folks’re doing who’ve lost everything they’ve had<br>
    In the singin and the laughin of the children when they’re glad<br>
    In the cryin and the quiet of when they’re scared</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        In the worry of the guilty ones that ain’t yet been caught<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there so help me God</p>
    
    <p>I guess I’d better go now, ma, cause soon it will be dawn<br>
    I’d just like to say I’m sorry for all the screwing up I done<br>
    But just cause I ain’t here no more it doesn’t mean I’m gone<br>
    I will be with you on every step of every stair</p>
    
    <p>Tomorrow when they come for me, you tell em I was here<br>
    Tell em that you saw me but that you didn’t see me clear<br>
    Tell em I’m the echo that’s been whispering in your ear<br>
    Tell em if they’re looking for me anywhere</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        Wherever someone’s lonesome in a stranded spot<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        Wherever folks are thirsty and can’t find a drop<br>
        Wherever there’s a road that ain’t been tried or trod<br> 
        Wherever I am wanted pursued or sought<br>
        I will be there, I will be there <br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>

    <p>Come mothers and fathers, come sisters and brothers<br>
    Lend an ear to the stories they’re telling<br>
    Of the neighborhood watchman in the Florida town<br>
    Who shot and killed Trayvon Martin</p>
    
    <p>O, the time it was night and the evening was cold<br>
    And the month it was late February<br>
    Trayvon Martin at only seventeen years old<br>
    Too young for an obituary</p>
    
    <p>On his way back home from a convenience store <br>
    Through the yards of his neighbors was walkin<br>
    George Zimmerman spied him while making his rounds<br>
    And made a call down to the station</p>
    
    <p>“HQ, HQ,” Mr. Zimmerman said,<br>
    “This is nightwatchman Zimmerman calling,<br>
    I have just spied a suspicious black male<br>
    In our gated community walking—</p>
    
    <p>“How shall I proceed, shall I make an arrest<br>
    Shall I follow and see where he takes me?<br>
    Could this be the man whom we’ve been looking for<br>
    Who committed those robberies lately?”</p>
    
    <p>“Well this is HQ,” the headquarters said,<br>
    “To nightwatchman Zimmerman calling,<br>
    Do not pursue—repeat—do not pursue,<br>
    For you haven’t the grounds to suspect him.”</p>
    
    <p>“Ten four, ten four,” Mr. Zimmerman said,<br>
    But he pulled up to roll slowly by him,<br>
    And when the young man saw the slow police car<br>
    He took off a fearfully runnin</p>
    
    <p>“No grounds? No grounds?” Mr. Zimmerman thought<br>
    “If there’s no grounds then why is he running?”<br>
    And quick as a flash he leapt out of his car<br>
    Bringing his handgun with him</p>
    
    <p>Well over a fence and through the back yards<br>
    The armed officer chased Trayvon Martin<br>
    A distance in excess of one hundred yards<br>
    Til he finally cornered and caught him</p>
    
    <p>O down, O down to the ground they did fall<br>
    The ground where they both had been standing<br>
    Trayvon to fight for his life gainst the man<br>
    The man for to somehow subdue him</p>
    
    <p>“Submit, submit!” ficer Zimmerman cried<br>
    “Submit and throw down your weapon!”<br>
    “I will not submit!” Trayvon Martin replied,<br>
    “For I’m unarmed and I haven’t done nothing!”</p>
    
    <p>And as the two fought on the ground in the dark<br>
    A gunshot rang out clear as crystal<br>
    Trayvon Martin had been shot through the chest<br>
    At close range by Zimmerman’s pistol</p>
    
    <p>Come mothers and fathers, come sisters and brothers<br>
    Lend an ear to the stories they’re telling<br>
    Of the neighborhood watchman in the Florida town<br>
    Who shot and killed Trayvon Martin</p>
    
    <p>For a day and a night the body went without name<br>
    As he was when his mother had birthed him<br>
    Until a call came from his father at home<br>
    Saying that his son had been missing</p>
    
    <p>O down, o down to the morgue he was called<br>
    To see if this was his son who’d been missing<br>
    “O, God, it’s him!” his bereaved father cried,<br>
    “That’s the body of Trayvon Martin,”</p>
    
    <p>“My son, my son, O Trayvon, my son—”<br>
    His poor mother cried, nearly wild,<br>
    “He wasn’t no symbol, didn’t die for no cause,<br>
    He was only my baby, my child,</p>
    
    <p>“And what did he do, for what was he killed,<br>
    For wearing dark clothes and a hoodie?<br>
    Is it just me or does it still feel <br>
    Like it’s a crime to be black in this country?”</p>
    
    <p>Well charges were pressed and a trial was set <br>
    And a jury was formed all at random<br>
    And of the twelve who were chosen to serve,<br>
    There wasn’t one black face among them</p>
    
    <p>“The defendant, George Zimmerman,” the prosecution declared,<br>
    “He is getting away here with murder;<br>
    How can you defend a defender of peace<br>
    Who says shoot first and ask questions later?”</p>
    
    <p>“Yes, that was my gun, I fired that round,”<br>
    George Zimmerman finally admitted<br>
    But despite all the facts in the end he was found<br>
    Not guilty and was fully acquitted</p>
    
    <p>The defense lawyers claimed he had just stood his ground<br>
    And no evidence showed the contrary<br>
    Trayvon Martin by then for more than a year<br>
    Neath six feet of ground had lain buried</p>
    
    <p>And for all you who say that here justice was done,<br>
    Here is something for you to consider:<br>
    When a white man shoots and unarmed black man to death<br>
    They do not define it as murder</p>
    
    <p>Come judges, come kings, come you counselors on down<br>
    Who maintain the law’s fair and equal<br>
    Come look what they done in a florida town<br>
    And say it would be the same for all people</p>

    <h2>Two Geese</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Sam Steffen EP, 2014</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#samSteffenEP_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Two geese flew over the house lastnight, a gentle music played upon their wings<br>
    The sun had softened to an evening light, my mind was overfilled with things<br>
    They came from somewhere well behind the sun, made their way out over the pond<br>
    And tho I didn’t see from where they’d come, I watched them til they’d gone</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they flew so close<br>
        That silence seemed to sail between them both<br>
        Perhaps I’m only more bemused than most<br>
            And by the simplest things I see<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>I turned from the window and I went downstairs, and I stepped out into the yard<br>
    December’s always been this wet and cold, but it’s never felt this hard<br>
    I pulled the clothes in down from off the line just as the stars began to cloud<br>
    And tho I hadn’t in the longest time, I said your name out loud</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they stayed in stride<br>
        Flying freely tho side by side<br>
        Perhaps I haven’t anything to hide<br>
            Or very much that’s left to lose<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>I brought a log in down from off the pile and I tossed it on the coals<br>
    I fanned and coaxed it for a little while until that flame burned bright and full<br>
    And as the fire raged within the hearth and I grew more conscious and wide awake<br>
    A peace within my soul was perched, but those two birds I couldn’t shake</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they flew so fast<br>
        Out of the future right into the past<br>
        Perhaps there’s nothing that’s really meant to last<br>
            That wasn’t born to stay<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>Now, the midnight sky in east Vermont is darker than you might suppose<br>
    And the stars you wait upon and want are seldom undisclosed<br>
    I read for a while, and then I went to bed, feeling distracted to say the least<br>
    And for a long time after I put down my head, I thought about those geese</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they seemed to fear<br>
        That they were too far north for this time of year<br>
        Or something about the way they disappeared<br>
            Right when they were close enough to hold<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>I woke this morning to a shade of sun, pressing warmly up against my face<br>
    And tho I knew I’d be the only one, I did not disturb your place<br>
    I got to my legs and then I stood upright, before the window I threw wide the blinds<br>
    Two geese flew over the house last-night, this morning you were on my mind</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way it seemed their fate<br>
        That after nearing they would separate<br>
        Perhaps it’s just that it was getting late<br>
            And they’d come right out of the blue<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>

    <p>Might be raining, might be snowing<br>
    That old north wind, she might be blowing<br>
    Through the treetops, down the sidewalks, <br>
    Past the rest-stops of this restless world<br>
    But tonight, babe, I am not afraid<br>
    I will not be roused before the dawn<br>
    For I have travelled a thousand miles<br>
    And cept to sleep I don’t know where I’m goin</p>
 
    <p>Come tomorrow but please come slowly<br>
    Shine your lights on but shine them lowly<br>
    For in the nighttime sweet sleep she takes me<br>
    Through my dreams until she forsakes me<br>
    Beyond the brink of what I can think of<br>
    With my weary waking mind<br>
    Let her lead me, let her deceive me,<br>
    But o please let me leave my cares behind</p>
 
    <p>I may be unlovely, may not have money<br>
    Seldom a ceiling over and above me<br>
    May come a beggar and leave a debtor<br>
    Having only my dreams to offer<br>
    But in my dreams you are always with me<br>
    Lying beside me up within my bed<br>
    And dreaming’s easy, when you’re weary<br>
    I do it every place I rest my head </p>

    <h2>A Twenty-Something College Graduate's Talkin Blues</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Sam Steffen EP, 2014</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#samSteffenEP_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>A while back I spose it hasn’t been too long<br>
    To a certain institution I used to belong<br>
    Where I spent four years and learned all the rules<br>
    And how to tell between the wise and the fools<br>
        I’m not talking about prison<br>
        It was a college, of the liberal arts variety</p>
 
    <p>Well we all got told to save the date<br>
    As the time was comin for us to graduate<br>
    And I guess you could say we were pretty excited<br>
    Everyone we knew had been invited<br>
        Folks and friends, friends of friends,<br>
        Heck, even the neighbors were there</p>
 
    <p>Well until at last the day was come<br>
    And our dean was standin up at the podium<br>
    And he made this speech it didn’t sound too subtle<br>
    He said, I’ll be honest, you’re all in trouble<br>
        And I’m not talking about academics<br>
        I’m talking about life now, now’s when the learning starts</p>
 
    <p>I can say right now it didn’t feel too good<br>
    To have to hear all that I knew I would<br>
    But we all went up and we shook his hand <br>
    And he said someday we’d understand<br>
        And I took my diploma<br>
        No secrets, that thing was just a piece of paper</p>
 
    <p>Well somehow I had made the grade,<br>
    Had a scholarship for my financial aide<br>
    And everyone was saying it would all be fine<br>
    You just take it easy, now, and take your time<br>
        You’ll have a job soon<br>
        Just gotta see what’s there—stay positive</p>
 
    <p>Well before I cleared out they sent me a notice<br>
    Said they wanted to see me at the financial office<br>
    So they called me in, said Take a seat<br>
    Wrote me out this big receipt<br>
        I said, what is this?<br>
        They laughed at me, said, You’re kidding, right?</p>
 
    <p>Well I told the woman to knock it off<br>
    It’ll take me ten years to pay this off<br>
    She said that’s right it’s called a ten year plan<br>
    That should be easy enough to understand<br>
        Aint it? for a smart-looking college graduate like you</p>
 
    <p>She said not to worry though, I’m sure<br>
    Youll find a job somewhere with that degree of yours<br>
    She said maybe I can help you, say what’s it in<br>
    I said 19th century American Literature—she laughed again<br>
        A veritable cackle that woman had<br>
        I never knew I was so funny</p>
 
    <p>Now in college you can learn to think<br>
    To read to write to speak to drink<br>
    And all of that can be put to use <br>
    As a post-graduate on the career caboose<br>
        Especially the drinkin—job huntin<br>
        And no luck on account of you’re overqualified</p>
 
    <p>Well it wouldn’t be so bad I guess<br>
    Cept the conomy’s broke and the world’s a mess<br>
    And you can’t get hired for a minimum wage<br>
    And there’s nothing for you on the classifieds page<br>
        You just sit around, feeling sorry<br>
        Got lots of time to read though</p>
 
    <p>Well, when I was finally through procrastinatin<br>
    I filled me out a labor application<br>
    Took a little math test, they gave me a cup<br>
    Showed me to the bathroom and said, filler up!<br>
        I passed that math test<br>
        The other one came back inconclusive</p>
 
    <p>Few days later they got a hold of me<br>
    Said they had a job waiting for me at the factory<br>
    Said to show on up and to be on time<br>
    You’ll be standing all day on the ssembly line<br>
        And they weren’t kidding—I stood in one place for 8 hours<br>
        Didn’t have a productive thought the whole time</p>
 
    <p>Well I did this I guess for about a week<br>
    Losing all kinds of time to work and sleep<br>
    And one day the foreman says I look like hell<br>
    And I says I know it man, he says well—<br>
        What can you do? Sometimes life just slips away<br>
        You gotta work though, or its hell to pay</p>
 
    <p>He said you know I always meant to go to college<br>
    To fill my head up with all kinds of knowledge<br>
    I said if I were him, I’d be apprehensive<br>
    It’s grand and all, but man, it’s expensive<br>
        He looked at me, he said, you mean you been to school?<br>
        I said, yeah, of course!</p>
 
    <p>Well I don’t think my comments were appreciated<br>
    Next day I found out I’d been terminated<br>
    I said what gives he says You wont miss it<br>
    You got a diploma—go do something with it</p>
 
    <p>Well I’ve had a couple of jobs since then<br>
    Couple of gigs with a couple of friends<br>
    Bought a bus ticket, pulled an all-nighter<br>
    Moved to Nashville, became a songwriter<br>
        It’s a pretty shabby way to make a living<br>
        All tips, and not too many of em, either—</p>

    <p>I don’t want to say I’m sorry<br>
    I don’t want to make it better<br>
    I don’t want to tell you I was wrong<br>
    I don’t want to be a grown-up<br>
    I don’t want to write no letter<br>
    I don’t want to show you I can be strong<br>
        All I want is to be left alone<br>
        For to lick my wounds and nurse my bruise<br>
        To get old quickly and remain unknown<br>
        But to sing—the blues</p>
 
    <p>I don’t want to listen to ya<br>
    I don’t want to be there for ya<br>
    I don’t want to reach out no helpin hand<br>
    I don’t want to hear what you think<br>
    I don’t want to owe you nothing<br>
    I don’t want no one to understand<br>
        All I want is to be sent on home<br>
        For my behavior to remain unexcused<br>
        To reap far less than what I have sewn<br>
        But to sing—the blues</p>
 
    <p>I don’t want to keep my voice down<br>
    I don’t want to hold my head up<br>
    I don’t want to play the game no more<br>
    I don’t want to hold my tears in<br>
    I don’t want to keep from hurting<br>
    I don’t want it to go on like before<br>
        All I want is to roll my stone<br>
        To know my fate ain’t mine to choose<br>
        To lose my joy along with all I own<br>
        But to sing—the blues</p>
 
    <p>I don’t want to make you happy<br>
    I don’t want to hear your answer<br>
    I don’t want to hope it’ll turn out fine<br>
    I don’t want to plan the future<br>
    I don’t want to look behind me<br>
    I don’t want to keep on trine<br>
        All I want is for the wind that’s blown<br>
        To carry off any last good news<br>
        To know that sorrow is all I’ve known<br>
        And to sing—the blues    </p>

    <h2>Jericho</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Someone Else's Blues, 2014</i>Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#someoneElsesBlues_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>From inside the walls through the chambers and halls every call falls in deafening echo<br>
    Back onto the ears of the ones still in here whom the system condemned from the get-go<br>
    Hear tell of a place where no man has a face on account of his case was mishandled <br>
    Its called Jericho it’s the old status quo it was left long ago undismantled</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come when each voice raised as one<br>
        Will erupt from the crowd in a shattering sound<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and the warden will know <br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>They step off the trains and they’re put into chains and their names’re all changed into numbers<br>
    It’s all an attempt to make someone exempt from recognizing himself in another <br>
    The one who presides presumes to decide that who lives and who dies is up to him<br>
    Its based on the facts but the conclusions, they lack all the feelings they used to get to em<br>
    <br>
    (The political line that claims to be tough on crime and aims to punish the worst and the baddest<br>
    Has foregone the facts and’s just trine to keep blacks in a permanent second-class status<br>
    The government funds for education and low-income housing’s out-moded<br>
    While the money’s increased for cops and police, and the population of prison’s exploded)</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come without lifting a gun<br>
        Every voice will the edge of the city surround<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and the governors will know<br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>They’re poor to begin they’re taught they can’t win when they’re brought in it aint to bear witness<br>
    They’re deemed by a judge unfit to be much call it justice but its just a business<br>
    The one who presides claims that his eyes have been cleansed by their own colorblindness  <br>
    He and the rest all think they’re doin their best, and that the age of racism’s behind us<br>
    (But the ones on lock-down are mostly black or they’re brown and they’re poor and they’re misrepresented<br>
    And as far as the count on who’s been in and out–the numbers are unprecedented)</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come where by ceasing to run<br>
        We’ll not be turned back nor told to turn round<br>
        And the trumpets will blow, and the judges will know <br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>The prisons’re run by the corporations so your freedom’s the price of a profit<br>
    And no one’s to blame cause to them it’s a game, trying to fill in a bottomless pocket<br>
    The cycle won’t break it accounts for mistakes and it knows that you’ll make and repeat em<br>
    But the killers ain’t killed as long as they’re killed and the prisons’re as filled as they need em</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come when the songs that we’ve sung<br>
        Will within every breast alight and resound<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and the hangman will know<br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>They’re brought into here to do what it ain’t clear to where no one can say what he’s seeing<br>
    They’re hated and scorned and their cries are ignored and they won’t hear the words human being<br>
    (Jesus spake from the hill “go and do what you will, but treat thyself as thou wouldst others<br>
    Is it so hard to see that you do unto to me what you do to the least of my brothers?”)<br>
    Hear tell of a spot where a man is forgot spite of whether or not they convict him<br>
    Its called Jericho it’s the place that you go from the criminal into the victim</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come where by beating the drum<br>
        Every voice from the silence shall again be unwound<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and all you will know <br>
        Is that the walls of Jericho have come down</p>

    <h2>Someone Else's Blues</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Someone Else's Blues, 2014</i>Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#someoneElsesBlues_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Last time we talked we didn’t say too much I don’t guess<br>
    Something about how maybe we were finally getting to be a little bit too old for this<br>
    There was a little bit of time yet then wrapped around your wrist <br>
    The end of the autumn in a November evening mist<br>
        But you should’ve seen your face that day it was the color of the gentle rose you wore in your lapel<br>
        While the captain raised a clamour and the widow clanged that old church-bell<br>
        They say lightning never strikes the same place twice<br>
        And I’m standing here thinking if it struck anywhere, just once would be more than nice<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            And we did not both know what we’ve both been through<br>
            I guess then I’d just be in someone else’s shoes<br>
            I guess I’d be singing someone else’s blues</p>
 
    <p>Your eyes once in a fleeting car moved past, and I swear I only caught the briefest glimpse<br>
    You did not see my standing on that street-corner to which by the way I have not been back since<br>
    I used to go out wandering from drug- to department-store<br>
    thinking maybe that I was the one who’s not who he sposed to be anymore<br>
        But it’s not an easy thing I don’t guess, to know you were not born alone and when<br>
        You can still go anywhere but you can’t go home again<br>
        They say lightning never twice the same place strikes<br>
        They say there’s no difference at all between some look alikes<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            What would there be left for us to misconstrue<br>
            Two vacant seats now in that old church pew<br>
            For someone else to sit with someone else’s blues</p>
 
    <p>Tomorrow we’re gone, at least today we’re still here<br>
    And you can still see the sun in that mud-puddle of yours that you call a mirror<br>
    Remember the time we got so turned around and ended up in some old playhouse?<br>
    And before the last act we both left to let the midnight river serenade us?<br>
        Come out, come out, wherever you are, the children scream<br>
        The games they play reminding us that this is not just some crazy dream<br>
        They say lightning never twice strikes the same place<br>
        As though when you try to repeat, all you do is erase<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            And we had not drifted the older we grew<br>
            I guess then I wouldn’t be here trying to choose<br>
            Now between mine and someone else’s blues</p>
 
    <p>Those were the days of the wind and the rain<br>
    The only difference is that now, well, they’re exactly the same<br>
    I sent you a letter a while back just to see how you are<br>
    And can you still play piano on that old worn out guitar<br>
        But you should’ve seen your face that day it looked not a thing like mine<br>
        Why’s it always the common sense that says it’s alright to just be yourself sometimes<br>
        Lightning never strikes the same place twice, they say<br>
        But even if it did they might not believe that anyway<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            Not I would not want not to not be not you<br>
            The hardest part about lovin you<br>
            Is that it has never been that hard to do</p>

    <p>You will know her by her eyes<br> 
    that will see right through your disguise<br>
    You will know by the way that the room falls away After she walks through the door<br>
    That for all that you’ve said about love’s being dead You’re not sure you believe anymore<br>
        And should you decide that not to have tried<br>
        Would afterwards only upset you inside<br>
        Don’t come crying to me, wanting to see, as if there could be any doubt<br>
        Whether that was the girl I was telling you bout</p>
 
    <p>You will know her by her voice<br>
    that will ask but will leave you no choice<br>
    You will know by the wish that she beckons you with By the way she says please to your lighter<br>
    That even if she says no, that she don’t want to go She don’t want you not to invite her<br>
        And should you admit it’d’ve been much better to quit<br>
        Before you went and got yourself all mixed up with it<br>
        I won’t say I was right, and I won’t pick no fight, but you know that I might have to shout<br>
        That that was the girl I was telling you bout</p>
 
    <p>You will know her by her hands<br>
    that not even she understands<br>
    You will know by the length of time that it takes To collect yourself after she’s left you<br>
    That you gave up too much in exchange for a touch That never consoled or caressed you<br>
        And if now and then you think you might do it again<br>
        If only this time to be prepared for the end<br>
        Well I guess that’s too bad you can’t want what you have but you know that I’m glad you found out<br>
        That that was the girl I was telling you bout</p>

    <p>Met a lady at a party she was hardly my type<br>
    But she invited me closer and I said, alright<br>
    Underscored me, ignored me, and she bored me to tears<br>
    But of all gazes hers was the gentlest</p>
 
    <p>Had me over got me sober even gave me a key<br>
    As she pulled the rug out from under me<br>
    Tried to sit up tried to get up to pick up the debris<br>
    But the odds they were stacked up against us</p>
 
    <p>Well you know me, Mr. Wait-and-see,<br>
        Mr. Cant-you-please-be-somewhat-kinder<br>
        As I’ll know by the sun when the morning has come<br>
        I will know my true love when I find her</p>
 
    <p>I been put up, I been stood up, been let up and let down<br>
    I been told to pick up and get out of town<br>
    Rejected, disrespected, and neglected so oft<br>
    I can’t tell anymore if you know me</p>
 
    <p>At the station congregations destinations unknown<br>
    Either tell me you love me or leave me alone<br>
    Among maestros in her plainclothes while the train pulls away<br>
    She says you don’t have to pay what you owe me</p>
 
    <p>Well you know me, Mr. wait-and-see<br>
        Mr. there-is-no-joy-separate-from-sorrow<br>
        And just like I would trade every heart for a spade<br>
        For yesterday I’d give all my tomorrows</p>
 
    <p>Well it’s lonely having only your memory to keep<br>
    As though I’d awakened to find that I was asleep<br>
    In the darkness cold and heartless will you part with your half<br>
    Whose hands were the words that you whispered with</p>
 
    <p>Was I dreaming, am I reading too much meaning into it?<br>
    Did you intend what you offered before you withdrew it<br>
    Do you miss me? Dismiss me? Would you kiss that mouth now<br>
    Whose words were the hands that I begged you with?</p>
 
    <p>Well you know me, Mr. Wait-and-see<br>
        Mr. upright-with-impeccable-posture<br>
        As you’ll not know the word for the thing you’ve endured<br>
        You’ll not know your true love til you’ve lost her</p>

    <p>Matthew he’s a friend of mine, used to put him up from time to time<br>
    Used to lend him nickles, quarters, dimes and dollars<br>
    Never had too much to say, went step by step and day by day<br>
    But soon every man must stray from what he fallers</p>
 
    <p>He always did alright in school never made the team but he played it cool<br>
    Each exception only breaks the rule it learns on<br>
    One day he got the thought to leave, shoved all his tricks in up his sleeve<br>
    He told them all one day they’d see he’d be gone</p>
 
    <p>Matthew, where are you?<br>
        Matthew, where are you?<br>
        Matthew, where are you?<br>
            Where are you?</p>
 
    <p>Can’t be sure but last I heard he was in a psychiatric ward<br>
    And he’d only sent home word so he could blame ya<br>
    Return address said San Marcos, letter said he was headed for the coast<br>
    Anywhere, he said, that’s nowhere close to Pennsylvania</p>
 
    <p>I’d know him now no more than you, couldn’t find him if I wanted to<br>
    I tried it once, without a clue to guide me<br>
    Just followed in his footsteps some, tried to get behind the sun<br>
    But just got lost without someone beside me</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>You left your home and left no trace for supper they still set your place<br>
    Fold their hands and all say grace without you<br>
    Your father still sits up to dawn in his bathrobe with his porchlight on<br>
    And folks they say he carries on and on about you</p>
 
    <p>And LeeAnn she still thinks of you, wonders what you’ve been up to<br>
    Says I only wish I knew that he was breathin<br>
    And your mother she’s still sleeping sound six feet underneath the ground<br>
    And once a year they all gather round a grievin </p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Matthew, do you still recall comin here with me when we were small<br>
    You wrote your name up on the wall in marker<br>
    Matthew won’t you please come home or try to find a telephone<br>
    Cause the days are getting shorter now, and darker</p>
 
    <p>Matthew, are you cold tonight, can you find your way without the light<br>
    Do you see the star that’s shining right above you?<br>
    Matthew, can you keep em shut, your ears from hearing you know what<br>
    They know you’ll never need it but they love you,<br>
    I know you’ll never want it but I do, too</p>

    <p>My mother was a shadow, or so I’ve heard the story told<br>
    My father rode the saddle, he never came in from out the cold<br>
    And I was born one hazy midnight, into a blanket I was rolled<br>
    Left upon a stranger’s doorstep when I was fifteen minutes old<br>
        Folks think that if I could find em now, I’d want to see em, they presume<br>
        Well as far as I’m concerned, I say, </p>
 
    <p>Never again would be too soon<br>
            Never again would be too soon<br>
            Never again would be too soon</p>
 
    <p>I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve had to go and leave my home<br>
    Whether on account of cause I always was, or else cause I was never left alone<br>
    Seems like every town I come to now is like every other town I’ve known<br>
    I come just long enough to learn of one more thing I’ll never own<br>
        And somewhere tween the sweepin floors and getting beaten with the broom<br>
        I say if I come back here anymore, </p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Well I loved a girl in New Orleans, although her name I don’t recall<br>
    She was kind and good to me, I was no good to her at all<br>
    I remember one night we’d just come back in from a ball<br>
    She had taken my possessions and locked them in the hall<br>
        I asked my girl how long it’d be for she’d let me back into her room<br>
        Well as far as I’m concerned, she said,</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Well I found me a friendly Christian, said I could stay with him for cheap<br>
    Said there was only one condition under which that contract he would keep<br>
    Said I had to start to livin clean, said he’d test me every week<br>
    Told him not to worry tho, I could do it in my sleep<br>
        Things were fine til they got hard again, and he found my needle and my spoon<br>
        I asked him when he’d let me back, he said,</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I killed a man in Kansas, I killed one in Tennessee<br>
    Both times I was as sorry as a man could ever be<br>
    Somewhere on the highway the law apprehended me<br>
    For one I got life in prison, for the other the death penalty<br>
        I asked the Lord if when I died he meant to raise me from my tomb<br>
        And something in the silence said,</p>
        
        <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Well I don’t know who I’m talkin to, I gues it doesn’t matter now<br>
    Anyone with ears’ll do, if the timin will allow<br>
    I’m only trine to figure out if there’s some way out of this somehow<br>
    If I never asked for help before, well, I’m sorry, but I’m askin now<br>
        The warden says my time’s been moved, so now I’m due to die at noon,<br>
        So if you’re wondering when to pray for me</p>

    I told her so right from the start<br>
    Eager to unite, we fell right apart<br>
    I should’ve seen it coming</p>
 
    <p>Tried again though, the second time was worse<br>
    The world’s a stage, but you can’t rehearse<br>

    It had commercial industry and basketball<br>

    I ran away so often</p>

        He only asks me things I know, he says that it’s important, though<br>
        I wish instead of asking he would tell me what to do<br>
        He’s quite encouraging, as if he thought I could make anything<br>
        Besides another failed attempt at getting over loving you</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been looking at the stars, trying to learn the constellations, making observations<br>
    I know Orion by now, and Cassiopeia, and I’ve a pretty good idea where the big and little dippers are<br>
        But astronomy is not for me, as anyone with eyes can see<br>
        I could watch that sky until the midnight turned to blue<br>
        And even if I knew the myths, what would they only leave me with<br>
        But another failed attempt at getting over loving you?</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been smoking long cigars, I imported them from Cuba, from Barbados and Bermuda<br>
    I’m not sure I like the taste of them, the sticky burning flavor, tho I’m quite fond of the paper that they wrap them in<br>
        But who am I trying to kid? I don’t like smoking and I never did<br>
        And I don’t give one good Goddam about where my tobacco grew<br>
        And even if I smoked incessantly, what would it only ever be<br>
        But another failed attempt at getting over loving you?</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been reading Russian novels from the latter nineteenth century, mainly Tolstoy and Dostoevsky<br>
    Sometimes I think I feel the same way as the characters they mention, who love in violent passion and dismay<br>
        Who always seem to know what’s best, who get what they want and then get depressed<br>
        Who suffer, bleed, and fight and die in search of something true<br>
        But every time I reach the end, I realize all my reading’s been <br>
        Is another failed attempt at getting over loving you</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been seeking some vocation, I need a new bad habit, I’m afraid I still don’t have it yet<br>
    I’ve tried coin- and stamp collecting, chocolate and wine tasting, bicycle and horse-racing<br>
        But I bet the coins on a losing horse, the stamps I sent to you, of course<br>
        Along with all my letters and every chocolate that I knew<br>
        And the wine that used to fill my shelf, I drank it quickly by myself<br>
        In another failed attempt at getting over loving you</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been listening to music, I’m learning the piano, I’m really not that good, tho<br>
    I can play a couple major chords, a few scales in the minor, I find the latter kinder to me<br>
        But what is all my practice for? I’m not improving, of that I’m sure<br>
        And I don’t know the song to play that has my kind of blues<br>
        And even if I found it out, what would I have to sing about<br>
        But another failed attempt at getting over loving you?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Someone Else's Blues, 2014</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#someoneElsesBlues_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Other day I got a phone call from a friend of mine,<br>
    Friend I ain’t seen in the longest time<br>
    Said he’s passin through town, like to pay me a visit<br>
    He says, you’re not busy, Sam, it’s not inconvenient is it?<br>
        I said, Busy? Boy it has been a while<br>
        I ain’t been busy since the late 1990s</p>
 
    <p>I said when’ll you be here, he says, One day or the next<br>
    Says, how bout when I’m close I shoot you a text<br>
    I said, What? He says, I’ll send a text-message<br>
    I said, And what’s that, exactly?—Sounds impressive<br>
        He says don’t tell me you don’t get text messages<br>
        I said, of course I do—post man brings em all the time</p>
 
    <p>He says, What’ve you been doing man, where’ve you been<br>
    Don’t you know what year it is? It’s 2014!<br>
    Now I don’t mean to startle you, but I’ll make no apology<br>
    But there’s a thing we’ve got now it’s called modern technology<br>
        I tell him I’ve heard of that—science fiction and whatnot<br>
        Gene splicing—animal cloning—drone strikes</p>
 
    <p>He says Not all of it’s bad for your information<br>
    Some of it’s improved our communication<br>
    I say, And how’s that?—he says, Well, for instance<br>
    Like you and me here, we’re talkin long distance<br>
        I asked him where he was calling me from <br>
        He said he’s sittin on the toilet in an airplane<br>
        Flying over the Atlantic ocean at a cruising altitude of 22,000 feet</p>
 
    <p>He says cell phones make it easier to keep in touch<br>
    With friends you don’t see or hear from much<br>
    Then he accuses me of being a reclusive-type<br>
    Then he says, Hang on a minute, I’ve got to wipe<br>
        I wonder at what point does information<br>
        Become too much information</p>
 
    <p>A minute later he comes back on<br>
    Picks right back up with the thread he’s been on<br>
    Says it’s also made working a breeze<br>
    I can talk to whomever wherever whenever I please<br>
        I made the mistake of asking him what line of work he was in nowadays<br>
        He says he’s a telemarkerter for Verizon Wireless<br>
        Cell phone salesman—spokesperson</p>
 
    <p>Well at no promptin of mine he starts to striking a deal<br>
    Lays it on me, goes into his spiel<br>
    He says, Do you ever find that your signal’s weak<br>
    And you’re getting cut off every time you try to speak?<br>
        I said what signal? I’m talking to you on a landline<br>
        Rotary telephone, circa 1948</p>
 
    <p>He says, Now hold the phone—let me get this straight,<br>
    You don’t even have a cell phone, am I hearing you right?<br>
    I’m about to respond when he says, Hold the line<br>
    I’m getting a call on the other line<br>
        Talk about getting cut off—<br>
        seems sometimes good reception’s not about where you’re talkin<br>
        but who you’re talkin to</p>
 
    <p>I tell him to call me back, he asks for my number<br>
    I said You’re the one who called me, remember?<br>
    I asked him how he found me after all this time<br>
    He says he looked me up in the phone book—online<br>
        I said man, I remember when the yellowpages were actually yellow<br>
        And actually pages, too!</p>
 
    <p>Well I hang up and wait for him to call me back<br>
    And I’m waiting a while, a whole month, in fact<br>
    One day the phone rings, it’s my old pal<br>
    He says, Sorry about that, I been tied up a while<br>
        Talking to friends, relatives, callin up strangers<br>
        Makin sales</p>
 
    <p>First thing he asks me is did I get his parcel<br>
    I’m about to say no when I hear the doorbell<br>
    Sure enough it’s the postman right on time,<br>
    He’s got a package for me, shows me where to sign<br>
        And it’s a cell phone, complete with phone, charger, instruction manual,<br>
        Service guide, return policy, insurance policy, etcetera…</p>
 
    <p>I said what’s all this, he says No need to thank me,<br>
    But welcome, at last, to the twentyfirst century<br>
    He says now I don’t have to sit at home<br>
    Whenever I want to use my telephone<br>
        He says you’re a free man, liberated from the cord<br>
        Welcome to the world of wireless</p>
 
    <p>I ask him how much am I gonna have to pay<br>
    To live like him in the technology age?<br>
    He says it varies but it’s likely to cost<br>
    Anywhere between thirty and a hundred bucks<br>
        That’s per month, though, he says—but just think of the benefits!<br>
        Unlimited minutes, roaming, plus texting</p>
 
    <p>I open the box, remove the packaging foam<br>
    There’s nothing inside even looks like a phone<br>
    Just a slab of metal the size of a bar of soap<br>
    I said, You are kidding me, right, I hope<br>
        Where do you aim your mouth on this thing?<br>
        Which end is the listening end? Durn thing doesn’t even have buttons on it!</p>
 
    <p>Well he explains to me how to turn it off and on<br>
    Gets into an explanation that’s a little overdrawn<br>
    All about how its not just a telephone<br>
    Its also a camera, a computer, a thousand things in one<br>
        You can record a video and send it in an email with a message attached<br>
        And you don’t even have to get out of bed—talk about shared experience</p>
 
    <p>Well I tell him I appreciate everything he’s sayin,<br>
    But I just can’t buy in to this game he’s playin<br>
    And I certainly don’t understand the attraction<br>
    To a device that can only cause you more distraction<br>
        Make you a rude theater-goer, an even worse driver<br>
        Pretty clumsy pedestrian, too</p>
 
    <p>I tell him, don’t get me wrong, I’m not ungrateful<br>
    I guess there’s a couple ways this could be useful<br>
    I tell him I got a door in here that’s always swingin open<br>
    I been meaning for a while to prop it open with something<br>
        This looks like it’d be just about the right size<br>
        Make a good paper-weight, too     </p>

    <h2>Ruth</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Ruth was married in the days of yore, at the altar made on the threshingfloor<br>
    A man said, “Will you take my hand? Will you wear my weddingband?<br>
    Will you say you love me evermore?”<br>
    Ruth said, “Yes,” even though she wasn’t sure; she knew that men are often insecure<br>
    That night they went to bed, when she woke up he was dead<br>
    She cursed him for what he’d promised her: he’d said,</p>
                <p>Whither thou goest, I will go, whither thou lodgest I will lodge<br>
                Thy people shall be my people, thy God my God<br>
                What thou wouldst have me do, I would d<br>
                Where thou diest, there will I also die; when no more tears are left to cry<br>
                Let it ring out through the land, your wish is my command<br>
                Just don’t send me away from you</p>
    <p>At the funeral, his mother wept and prayed, then when everyone was gone she stayed</p>
    The rain fell lightly down, all was quiet in the town,<br>
    Ruth was waiting on her in the glade<br>
    When she noticed, Ruth startled and almost fled; but the woman called her to her side instead<br>
    She said, “Come be at my side, all my sons have died—<br>
    My hopes for going on have turned to lead</p>
    
    <p>“Tell me, what am I supposed to do? If there’s anyone can help me tell me who<br>
    Is there anything that rhymes with a grief as deep as mine?<br>
    I get older but the pain is always new.”<br>
    For a whole week they knealt there without bread, without moving and without sleeping in a bed<br>
    And when the eighth day dawned, the woman said to Ruth, “Be gone!<br>
    What are you waiting for?” And then Ruth said,<br>
    
            <p>Chorus</p>

    <h2>Right Where We Left Off</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The last time you left, you told them goodbye<br>
    You told them you’d write, or call, or at least try<br>
    And they said, alright, they said, all our love,<br>
    And when you get back, we’ll pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>Will you remember my name? the way I’ll keep yours<br>
    Inside of my heart and soul and my kitchen drawers<br>
    Or some other place, somewhere it won’t get lost<br>
    So we can pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>If we could go back, or maybe go on ahead<br>
    If I could remember some of those lovely things we said,<br>
    Maybe that’d be alright, maybe that’d be enough<br>
    Maybe then we could pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>I wish I could fly, I wish I could swim<br>
    I wish I could do any of those things that remind me of him<br>
    I wish they’d come back at whatever the cost<br>
    I wish I could pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>Maybe there’d be a way, through some kind of grace<br>
    Where I could hold on to a light in this pointless chase<br>
    Where everything’d freeze every time you said ‘stop,’<br>
    Where we could pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>We’ll bust into that room, we’ll go back in time<br>
    We’ll show ourselves to ourselves and we’ll tell em everything’s gonna be just fine<br>
    And the record will play and the sound will be soft<br>
    And then we’ll pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>Just like turning a page to write the next line<br>
    Or saving a word so you’ll have something to say next time<br>
    You got to hold on, there will be no pause<br>
    And then we’ll pick up right where we left off</pp>

    <h2>If They Could Only See Us Now</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>My love sends me roses cause she knows I’m allergic<br>
    She pulls off the petals and marks the box ‘urgent’<br>
    Then she stands in the doorway and makes no disturbance<br>
    Even the light seems to soften for her</p>

    <p>She used to come closer we used to be gentle<br>
    To say how I loved her was unsentimental<br>
    And everyone said we had so much potential<br>
    But nobody knew how unhappy we were</p>

    <p>I used to get sore about breaking a promise<br>
    I didn’t want love if it couldn’t be honest<br>
    But of all my regrets I’d have to say that the fondest<br>
    Is that I will never forget you again</p>

    <p>You were the deathbed and I was the funeral<br>
    You were a number and I was a numeral<br>
    I never thought once to think that unusual<br>
    Until I thought it over and over again</p>

    <p>And now that I have the advantage of hindsight<br>
    And all of my life has been cast in the limelight<br>
    I can see I was wrong but don’t know how to make right<br>
    All of the troubles you wear on your brow<br>
    If only I could endure what I’m made of<br>
    If I could explain what I was afraid of</p>

        <p>Maybe that’d be enough to complete us<br>
        To hear from those who know that they need us<br>
        Just what they would think if they could only see us now</p>
 
    <p>Sometimes the day feels like a tedious project<br>
    A striving one tries for without any object<br>
    Without even laws or so much as a precept<br>
    To steer you or guide you or lead you back home</p>

    <p>You have to make do with what you’ve been given<br>
    Say that you meant to be where you were driven<br>
    Pretend you’re content with the life that you’re living<br>
    And maybe they’ll promise to leave you alone</p>

    <p>You said you were sick and I hoped you’d get better<br>
    I wrote you a song in the form of a letter<br>
    And your father wrote back and said, You’d better forget her<br>
    Whoever this is that you think that you are</p>

    <p>I thought what’s forbidden was all that’s worth loving<br>
    I thought he was kidding, didn’t know he was bluffing<br>
    You take the long shot and you’ll end up with nothing<br>
    His postscript I kept like the pain of a scar</p>

    <p>But after a while I spose you get used to<br>
    Knowing the things that used to confuse you<br>
    And even the habits to which they introduced you<br>
    Begin to seem like you need them somehow<br>
    If only I had a little more imagination<br>
    If I could withstand any duller sensation</p>

        <p>Or maybe if they would only heed us<br>
        Whenever we told them to please believe us<br>
        Perhaps they would hear if they could only see us now</p>

    <p>The anguish pours out in a language of nonsense<br>
    The present and future are both in the past tense<br>
    And history sits on the rim of a sequence<br>
    It cannot acknowledge and will not restart</p>

    <p>What is the point though, of making distinctions?<br>
    Between an injustice and just an extinction<br>
    There’s only a ballet of juxtapositions<br>
    And all of the dancers are moving apart</p>

    <p>The prophets are drafting their new manifestos<br>
    Leaving them published in coffeeshop windows<br>
    And sprayed on the backsides of boxcars whose cargoes<br>
    Are headed for a junkyard outside of Tucson</p>

    <p>Musicians are musing composing their movements<br>
    Jesters suggesting digestive amusements<br>
    To nobles bequeathing their thrones to a nuisance<br>
    Who will sell his own birthright before he moves on</p>

    <p>And when it comes down to the easiest option<br>
    To simply proceed without care or precaution<br>
    To throw up your hands at the back of the auction<br>
    And say that you’ll pay it back some day somehow<br>
    Will you remind me of the original prices<br>
    We paid to be left to our own devices</p> 

        <p>They said not to snap at the hands that feed us<br> 
        Sometimes I wonder how they would treat us<br>
        And what they would think if they could only see us now</p>

    <p>She never wore cotton she always wore satin<br> 
    When I first met her, she only spoke latin<br>
    And she made me promise to let nothing happen<br>
    I couldn’t undo or take back if I did</p>

    <p>You’ve taken advice from your supposed superiors<br>
    Whose practiced experience would not stoop to hear yours<br>
    You’ve learned every inch of all the interiors<br>
    But your nakedness somehow remains rather well hid</p>
 
    <p>I lived for a year as the ghost of an attic<br>
    Seeking a way that was more democratic<br>
    Screaming lost verbs in a downpour of static<br>
    Beneath a large hole I had carved in the roof</p>
 
    <p>And then I awoke as from a terrible nightmare<br>
    Groping the darkness and tangled in your hair<br>
    Murmuring echoes I recall reading somewhere<br>
    That was about when I parted with Truth</p>
 
    <p>As the voices of angels surround the cathedrals<br>
    And stand with the peasants who begin the upheavals<br>
    And teach it was goods that gave birth to the evils<br>
    With which we’ve been dealing our whole lives til now</p>

        <p>Will you recall why it was that we came here<br>
        And what we are doing inside this container<br>
        What were the words we were told that would ease us<br>
        Angel, joseph, mary, jesus,<br>
        What would they think if they could only see us now?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>My baby called me up lastnight, asked me if I felt alright<br>
    I said I’m okay, she said, alright, I’ll be there in an hour<br>
    She picked me up and took me to, every bar along the avenue<br>
    I tried to say when I was through, but it wasn’t in my power</p>
 
    <p>By the time the morning rolled around it seemed we’d been through half the town<br>
    I drunk so much I thought I’d drown if I didn’t die of thirst<br>
    She looked at me said aint this fun, and to think the weekend’s just begun<br>
    I said, now wait just a minute, hon, I got to break it to you first</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t know what you’re taking that keeps you going like you been<br>
    Coffee, cocaine, benzadrine or some amphetamine<br>
    But my energy is finite and it’s darn well near expired<br>
    And you know I hate to tell you, but my darling, I am tired</p>
 
    <p>Next morning she’s as good as new, got ten thousand new things to do<br>
    And every one she puts me through like it’s a test for me<br>
    Wants to run a race and ride her bike, swim cross the river and take a hike<br>
    And everything she says it like its as easy as can be</p>
 
    <p>Politely, I try to suggest that maybe we could just take a rest<br>
    Stop a while and catch our breath, or take a nap, at least<br>
    I just need a place to rest my head, don’t even need to be a bed<br>
    Just dig a hole and call me dead, but let me rest in peace</p>
 
    <p>Now I ain’t exactly lazy and in fact I work quite hard<br>
    I’m out of bed fore sunrise and I come home well past dark<br>
    I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and I’ll never be retired<br>
    But I ain’t exactly kidding when I tell you I am tired</p>
 
    <p>We made it home at half past three and right as I’m about to fall asleep<br>
    My babe says babe make love to me, and how could I refuse<br>
    We made it til the sun was high and the time for sleep had passed us by<br>
    I felt like I was gonna die if I didn’t cut her loose</p>
 
    <p>So I got dressed she said, What’s wrong, I said, I gotta be a getting on<br>
    She said, Wait, I said, So long, and climbed down from her arms<br>
    She said don’t you care for me? I said, I do, but can’t you see<br>
    Exhaustion, it breeds apathy, and your love’s bound to do me harm</p>
 
    <p>Now I’m tired of the homestead and I’m tired of the road<br>
    And I’m so tired of being tired I’m just about a ready to explode<br>
    Just a quiet place and darkness is all that I desired<br>
    From the moment that I met you all I been is well past tired</p>
 
    <p>Well, when I finally got a chance to sleep, I slept quite fast and hard and deep<br>
    Never mind the counting sheep, I just went out like a light<br>
    I slept for days and weeks and months, slept through my birthday more than once<br>
    I slept through all the arguments I might’ve had to fight</p>
 
    <p>Through earthquake fire flood and more, everything come knocking at my door<br>
    I slept right through the third world war and woke up all alone<br>
    I wandered through abandoned scenes in a vacant town among my dreams<br>
    To an empty port where a shanty leans and nobody is home</p>
 
    <p>Now if anyone can hear me, if there’s anybody left<br>
    That ain’t packed up in a graveyard waiting for a rest<br>
    I used to be so tired, but to sleep was my mistake—<br>
    If I could do it all again I’d wish for strength to stay awake</p>

    <p>Yonder she walks overtop of the rocks,<br>
    and every so often she thoughtfully stops<br>
    To untie her shoes, and to pull off her socks<br>
    Her beauty abounds beyond measure; I cannot handle the pressure<br>
    For even if somehow I<br>
    Could but capture her eye<br>
    And only to tell her, “I’m sorry—goodbye,”<br>
    There’d still be no way for to stand or to stay<br>
    For I’d not know what name by<br>
    which she goes to address her</p>
    
    <p>She carries her clothes and the wind her hair blows<br>
    And the ocean beside her it ebbs and it flows<br>
    Erasing her footprints and kissing her toes<br>
    As she tenderly wades through the mosses; she don’t know the pain that she causes<br>
    For even if I was sure<br>
    Of the sly conjecture<br>
    That what I feel for her is love, plain and pure<br>
    I’d still have to start<br>
    With a half-broken heart<br>
    That hopes, bears, believes and endures<br>
    Despite how all of its gains become losses</p>

    <p>Beneath the salt-waves, her fair body she bathes<br>
    And the seagulls above her observe her charades<br>
    Strongly she swims, to dive deeply, she saves<br>
    In her lungs, all the air she can gather; that it won’t last for long doesn’t matter<br>
    For even if I could change<br>
    Or only just rearrange<br>
    The conditions by which I’m made free in my chains<br>
    She still would beseech<br>
    Me and be out of reach<br>
    Of the arms that when she was in range<br>
    Could’ve swore that they had her</p>

    <p>From the watery deep she sings me to sleep<br>
    And slowly become I her question to keep<br>
    In my dreams she accosts me and asks me to speak<br>
    From inside the bounds of her clutches, she tells me to walk without crutches<br>
    And tho I’m to blame<br>
    For remaining the same<br>
    Despite and because of the size of the pain<br>
    She still won’t relent<br>
    Won’t requite or resent<br>
    And you can’t quite prevent how insane<br>
    She turns everyone that she touches</p>

    <p>You can stay in the stable, Cain, if you are able<br>
    And if you ain’t ready I’m sure that she’ll understand<br>
    She loves them all equal, the strong and the feeble<br>
    But you know to a new friend she prefers second-hands</p>

    <p>Her heart it is golden and her fingers are porcelain<br>
    And her hair ravenblack flows as long as her veins<br>
    You can borrow a dollar and from the fence you can call her<br>
    By any one of her ten-thousand-twenty-two names</p>

    <p>When the time comes to leave her, she will ask you to stay<br>
    And you’ll have to be honest, and just say you ain’t strong<br>
    Course I hope that you’re smarter than to put it that way<br>
    But whatever you tell her, you can’t make it too long</p>

    <p>She’ll sit in the chapel and chew on her apple<br>
    That somebody gave her, she didn’t see who<br>
    If you ask where it came from she’ll ask “Why, do you want some?<br>
    For the life of me, sweetheart, I thought it was you.”</p>

    <p>She lives in the country midst pastures of plenty<br>
    Where the wheat bravely staggers and the rye gently blows<br>
    When she needs a diversion she’ll make an excursion<br>
    To a place in the forest where nobody goes</p>

    <p>When you come to a clearing she will tell you to halt<br>
    And you’ll have to be honest and say you’re really surprised<br>
    And while you make your excuses and say it wasn’t your fault<br>
    Best be sure that you’re speaking with tears in your eyes</p>

    <p>Far from the centers she exits and enters<br>
    And stealthily glides midst the unnoticed crowds<br>
    You can follow her shadow, pretending she had no<br>
    Reason for drawing you underneath of her cloud</p>

    <p>She’s cold as a crystal and she carries a pistol<br>
    That carries six bullets she fires at will<br>
    When she blows you her kisses, know that she never misses<br>
    And you’d already be dead if just lookin could kill</p>

    <p>When she tells you her story and it runs your frame cold<br>
    Well, you’ll have to be honest and just say what you thought<br>
    Tho she’s only a child, she’s already too old<br>
    To remember that all that she knows she’s been taught</p>

    <p>The district attorney made a hell of a journey<br>
    One midsummer’s Sunday at the end of july<br>
    Even pulled by a bloodhound there was nothing to be found<br>
    In the end he just told her he only came to say hi</p>

    <p>Several months later in the onset of winter<br>
    When the lakewater surface had but frozen part way<br>
    A man was out huntin and he stumbled on something<br>
    That made him feel that he’d seen enough blood for one day</p>

    <p>When they came to arrest her with their shotguns unsheathed<br>
    Crying “Keep your eyes careful, boys, she needs to be watched,”<br>
    She came out on the porch and said, “Will you poor bastards, please,<br>
    Say what you think you could take from me I ain’t already lost?”</p>

    <p>You don’t have to sell it but that’s how they tell it<br>
    Hithers her homestead and yonders her grave<br>
    You could put up a statue, a figure of virtue<br>
    And Adonis-madonna for all the damn that she gave</p>

    <p>Born to an orphan who was born to an orphan<br>
    In east Oklahoma where she lived till she died<br>

    <h2>The Ballad of Abraham and Isaac</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 7</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>God called to Abraham, said “Abraham, my son,”<br>
    Abraham said, “Here I am—what is it you want done?”<br>
    Said, “Abraham, the time has come, go and get me your dearest son, And by tomorrow’s setting sun—<br>
    I want you to offer him up to me.”</p>

    <p>Well Abraham he went on home, and he sat down to his supper<br>
    Sarah asked him what he’d done, as he looked so pale and sober<br>
    He said, “I’ve done nothing, that’s just it, I must be dreaming or getting sick I think I just need to lie down quick!”<br>
    And he got up from the table</p>

    <p>That night he did not sleep a wink, but he lay in his bed tryin<br>
    The only thoughts that he could think, were of his young son’s lonesome dyin<br>
    For his life he couldn’t understand why it had to be by his own hand, why this had been his Lord’s command—<br>
    He couldn’t think of any reason</p>

    <p>Next morning, early, he arose—well before the sun had risen<br>
    Put on his hat and his morning clothes—brought along a knapsack with him<br>
    Then he stole into Isaac’s room, Brought him out beneath the moon And like a corpse, fresh for the tomb--<br>
    Isaac went on sleepin</p>

    <p>“Lord,” he said, “I’m beggin you—if ever you’ve been with me<br>
    For what I am about to do, I hope you will forgive me,”<br>
    Then Isaac, who had just woke up Said, “Forgive you, father? But for what?” He said, “Son, you know I’d tell you but—<br>
    Myself, I do not know yet.”</p>

    <p>Then Abraham he told his son of a journey he was makin<br>
    He said “If you choose I’ll let you come, but it has no destination<br>
    Bring up a mule and pack a tent, A rope, some tinder and some flint,” And obediently, Isaac went—<br>
    To do as he was bidden</p>

    <p>Then Abraham to Isaac called, “Isaac my dear son,”<br>
    Isaac answered, “Here I am—what is it you want done?”<br>
    He said, “Isaac, now the time has come Go and get me my Remington, the very best of all my guns—<br>
    And offer it up to me.”</p>

    <p>Well the rode until their shadows grew much taller than their figures<br>
    The frigid autumn evening blew the leaves against dead fixtures<br>
    And when the sky had turned to red Abraham to Isaac turned his head “Gather up some wood,” he said<br>
    “Here’s where we’ll build the altar.”</p>

    <p>“What will be our offering?” Isaac asked unto his father<br>
    “A lamb to kill we didn’t bring.” Abe said, “We needn’t bother,<br>
    What we brought will be just fine, Now hurry up, there ain’t much time,” And while Isaac went for some wood to find—<br>
    Abe loaded up his rifle</p>

    <p>Isaac left and then came running back, crying, “Father! Please come quickly,<br>
    I’ve spied a deer in a bramble patch—he’s caught up well and thickly,”<br>
    Abraham said, “Show me where,” Isaac took him, said “Right there,” And sure enough, within a snare—<br>
    A healthy deer was struggling.</p>

    <p>Abraham said, “Lord, my God—if ever you’ve been with me<br>
    For what I am about to do, I hope you will forgive me<br>
    I don’t pretend to understand Why you gave me that command But if I do or don’t I’m damned—<br>
    This is my situation.”</p>

    <p>And sayin that he raised his gun and laid his cheek against the barrel<br>
    In his range were both his dearest son and the deer so wild and feral<br>
    For a moment he observed the scene Like a man who can’t decide between Who needs someone to intervene—<br>
    To make his decision for him.</p>

    <p>But from the sky no angel came to stay his quaking finger<br>
    No spirit Abraham could name brought his hot hand to the trigger<br>
    And midst the depths of his deepest doubt “Shoot, father!” Isaac shouted out And from the woods one shot rang out—<br>
    Followed closely by another.</p>

    <p>And whether he first shot the deer, thinking that would be sufficient<br>
    And afterwards shot the boy when he realized that it wasn’t<br>
    Or whether he first killed his son, then himself when he realized what he’d done Or fired twice at the setting sun—<br>
    To this day, there is no telling.</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The kettle is screaming from its place on the stove<br>
    Still dark but it’s morning, Mary’s in her bathrobe<br> 
    Those boys better wake up, she says to herself<br>
    But she knows they ain’t sleeping—no, they’re somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>She pours out the coffee, and she throws on a quilt<br> 
    Steps out on the front porch that her late husband built<br>
    And as she stares at the ocean, she recalls how she felt<br>
    To be a young woman who longed to be somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>But she’d married a sailor who’d married the sea<br>
    And she’d borne him three children uncomplainingly<br>
    And whenever they took sick she’d nurse them right back to health<br>
    By feeding them stories about somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>Then one day in November, her husband called All Aboard<br>
    For the very last time and was lost overboard<br>
    They brought her his jacket, his boots and his belt<br>
    Said, “He might not be drowned, ma’am, might just be somewhere else.”</p>

    <p>For ten days they waited, then they waited ten more<br>
    For his body or his clothing to wash up on shore<br>
    But it only got colder and the ice wouldn’t melt<br>
    So they finally concluded he was just somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>And her boys grew to manhood—tho much to her dismay<br>
    And despite how she urged them, they took up the old trade<br>
    First was lost near Tahiti, the second drowned way down south<br>
    The third his brothers went seeking, and wound up somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>They say not to lose hope, they say not to despair<br>
    Just because they don’t come back don’t mean they ain’t there<br>
    They say to have courage, you know but it hardly helps<br>
    When your heart is in one place and your love’s somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>The ships have come back now, they’re moored at the pier<br>
    And the sailors are drunk now, on their whiskey and beer<br>
    And upon barroom counters captains divvy their wealth<br>
    But the wives and the widows, aw, they’re somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>The Lord he may giveth and he may taketh away<br>
    But if you need a good reason, the Bible won’t say<br>
    And as she blows out her candle, and puts the book on the shelf<br>
    She thinks, “If God’s in his heaven, I must be somewhere else.</p>

    <p>Taxi lady, tell me where to—can I take you long the avenue?<br>
    You still lookin for that prince you said you knew? And does he still have your other shoe?<br>
    Taxi lady, I guess it’s been a while—I’m glad to see tho that you still ain’t lost your style<br>
    But say what happened to your winning smile? It used to be worth more than just a mile<br>
    Taxi lady, how’d you get to be so sad—you look just like you lost whatever chance you had<br>
    But nevermind you’ll see it ain’t that bad, once you’ve had a ride in my good ol taxi cab<br>
    Taxi lady, won’t you tell me what you want, expensive dinner at some four star restaurant?<br>
    To spend a whole night at the hotel Altamont? You name the date and I can take you if you want<br>
    Taxi lady, can I take you for a ride, up to the highway or the lonesome riverside<br>
    You seem like the kind of girl with nothing left to hide, I’m the kind of man with nothing left inside<br>
    Taxi lady, tell me where you’re comin from, it’s so cold tonight my hands are getting numb<br>
    I can’t tell you how many miles I’ve just come, not to get to you but just to anyone</p>

    <p>At the next stop take a right, then go down there right on through that trafficlight<br>
    You can circle the block a couple times it’s alright, but taxi, take me home tonight</p>

    <p>Taxi lady, well, now that you asked, I got lots of troubles all up buried in my past<br>
    I try to get away but this taxi ain’t too fast, seems like some of what is there is there to last<br>
    Taxi lady tell me how you been, you know I haven’t always driven this machine<br>
    I used to have a job I wrote songs for a queen, it was a lot like this if you know what I mean<br>
    Taxi lady, keep your change this one’s on me, you find me again and you can always ride for free<br>
    I ain’t scared of having no place to be, I’m just afraid of having no one to take with me<br>
    Taxi lady won’t you take the whole night off, we’ll go wherever you can possibly think of<br>
    And if by the end you still ain’t had enough I got a bottle waiting back in the garage<br>
    Taxi lady tell me what you got to lose, another evening settin at home with the blues<br>
    This ain’t no limosine but it’ll do for just a cruise, down past the marquis and the crowded avenues<br> 
    Taxi lady, say again where do you live, I hope it ain’t among that crowd I seen you with<br>
    Don’t say you’re sorry I don’t know what that is, I’m one of those whose done too much sinning to forgive</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Taxi lady, will you ever find your prince? I heard he lives up in those project tenements<br>
    You know I barely make enough to pay my rents, but I don’t want your money, I’ll just take your compliments<br>
    Taxi lady, how bout some other night, we’ll get together, we’ll do it right<br>
    Give me a signal but please make it bright; you put out your hand and I’ll put out my light<br>
    Taxi lady, I must bid thee now, adieu; I feel somehow that our acquaintanceship ain’t thru<br>
    I can’t tell you who to be or what to do, but there’s a thousand more out here tonight like you</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 11</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Well I went to visit grandma just the other week,<br>
    she seemed so glad to see me doin well<br>
    She didn’t look so bad herself for a woman of her age,<br>
    that she was almost 93 you’d never tell</p>
 
    <p>Well we got to catchin up a bit as it had been a little while,<br>
    granny said she’d done a bit of traveling of late<br>
    I figured she meant around the house or down the road a little ways—<br>
    that was my first mistake</p>
 
    <p>Said she’d been all over Europe, all through England and through France,<br>
    said she’d swam across the Adriatic sea<br>
    Then she came back to the United States and she visited each one,<br>
    and then got home just in time for hostin me</p>
 
    <p>well every story that granny told me seemed a little more surprising than the last<br>
    til finally I had to interrupt her at some length<br>
    I said, Granny, I believe you, but I just have to ask<br>
    What is the secret to your strength?</p>
 
    <p>She said, “Aw, well that’s an easy one, you know I always watch my weight<br>
    And I’ve always kept my posture good so that I wouldn’t stoop<br>
    I take vitamins and exercise and every day I have one bowl<br>
    Of grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure blindness! It’ll make you whoop (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again</p>
 
    <p>Now I must say when granny said all this my curiosity was aroused,<br>
    I said, Now of what does this here said soup consist?<br>
    Before she even answered me she said, “Would you like a taste of some?”<br>
    I shrugged and said, “Well, if you insist.”</p>
 
    <p>Then she went over to the fridge and she pulled out a great big pot<br>
    That looked to be leftovers from the latest batch<br>
    And takin off the lid she exclaimed, “Darn—fresh out!<br>
    Not to worry though, we’ll just start again from scratch!”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure baldness! It’ll make you whoop (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again</p>
 
    <p>Well the first thing that she did was bring some water to a boil<br>
    Added salt and pepper and vinegar and a little gin<br>
    In another pan she heated up a little bit of olive oil<br>
    Then she cut up an onion and some veggies and threw em in</p>
 
    <p>Then while all of that was cookin she went out into the yard<br>
    Told me to keep an eye on that there bubbling broth<br>
    She came back in with a live hen, tossed it whole into the pot<br>
    Didn’t even kill it first or take it’s feathers off</p>
 
    <p>And before I could object, she had left the room again,<br>
    Went and gathered every soiled bedsheet in her home<br>
    And when all the laundry was collected she nonchalantly stirred it in<br>
    Said, “It’s like killing two birds with one stone!”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure arthritis! It’ll make you whoop! (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again!</p>
 
    <p>Well, when she had taken out her laundry and had hung it out to dry,<br>
    She said, and now we’ll add the noodles to the mix<br>
    But upon inspection of her pantry, not a morsel caught my eye<br>
    Granny looked and said, “Well aw—fiddlesticks!”</p>
 
    <p>Then a look came over granny that was at first desperate and then fierce<br>
    Then she snapped her fingers and said she knew just the thing<br>
    She said, “Well you’ve got shoes on,” I said, “Yes, and what of that?”<br>
    She said, “Well—get em off! We need them strings!”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll take the paint off—it’ll make you whoop (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why it’ll almost make you young again!</p>
 
    <p>Well when everything was in there and it had simmered for a while,<br>
    Granny stirred it up and said it was almost done<br>
    Then she got me out a bowl and she got me out a spoon<br>
    And said, “I’ll bet you just can’t wait to try you some,”</p>
 
    <p>Now I’ve never been a one to treat my elders with disrespect<br>
    And I’ve never been one to deliberately seem rude<br>
    But after seeing what I had of those ingredients and all,<br>
    I should have hesitated to call what that was food</p>

    <p>So I said, Granny, I’m obliged, but I think I’m gonna pass,<br>
    She said, “Now, I don’t want to hear none of that there lip!”<br>
    She ladeled me a bowl and set it down and crossed her arms<br>
    I gulped and shut my eyes and took a sip of</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll clean you out—it’ll make you whoop! (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again</p>
 
    <p>Well the next thing that I knew I was passed out cold upon the floor<br>
    Granny was standing over me, saying, “Do you know where you are?”<br>
    I said, “Go and get a doctor,” but she had no phone or car,<br>
    And so she carried me all the way to the E.R.</p>
 
    <p>Few days later I was better all laid up in my hospital bed,<br>
    The doctor said he’d never seen a case so bad<br>
    He said, “I mean it’s like you were poisoned or something!” I said, “Yeah, pretty much,”<br>
    He said, “Do you know what you ate?” I said, “All I had was</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll give you courage—it’ll make you whoop!<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why it’ll almost make you young again!</p>
 
    <p>Well granny came to see me later on that afternoon<br>
    Brought me some flowers and some home-made medicine<br>
    She said, “I have no idea how you got so sick, but this here will cure you sure!”<br>
    I rolled my eyes, and said, “Here we go again—”</p>
 
    <p>Grandmas’ famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Some say it’s a blessing, some say it’s a curse<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure you—if it doesn’t kill you first!</p>

    And in between there I visited a lot of places, shook a lot of hands, saw a lot of faces<br>
    I got pretty close to some things you wouldn’t want to go near, I heard some things you’d probably not want to hear</p>
 
    <p>But of all the towns that I can recollect now there’s one I remember being different somehow<br>
    Cause there was this man, I don’t guess you’d doubt it, he did this thing, well let me tell you about it:<br>
    Well, it was a midsummer’s evening if I remember right, I’s hunting up a place where I could stay the night<br>
    And I came on a crossroads about a quarter past seven, only thing there’s a hotel and a tavern</p>
 
    <p>Well the door was open, and there was a candle burning, it wasn’t anything too fancy or nothing<br>
    But it looked like a place you might get a drink, have a spot to sit and some time to think<br>
    So I go on in, I’m the only one there, except for the bartender of course and two other guys there<br>
    And they was rough old boys, you should’ve seen em, so I go on up sit down in between em</p>
 
    <p>I say, “Busy night?” No one laughs; tender comes over he’s wiping a glass<br>
    He says, “I never seen you in here before,” I said, “That’s cause I never been in here before,”<br>
    He says, “Where you from?” I say, “Nowhere special,” he says, “Passin through, eh? Right on schedule…”<br>
    Well, we talked that way for a little while, neither one of the other two even crackin a smile</p>
 
    <p>Finally the bartender tells me that I look thirsty, I say, “Thanks, friend, I ain’t had a drink since Thursday,”<br>
    So he pours me a beer, I thank him for the service, he says, “You alright, man? You seem kinda nervous…”<br>
    Well I guess I must’ve been moving my eyes back and forth betwixt these two other guys<br>
    So I say, “What’s the story with these two fellas?” Tender perks up, says “Well, let me tell you</p>
 
    <p>“The man to your right is a righteous man, man I’d trust about as far as I can<br>
    He doesn’t say much that ain’t worth saying, but a word from him is a word worth saving<br>
    The man to your left’s a whole other story, belongs to his very own category<br>
    I don’t guess there’s much that man ain’t said, gainst friend or enemy, livin or dead—”</p>
 
    <p>As soon as he says that this bottle comes flying, the tender ducks and it breaks behind him<br>
    One of em threw it I couldn’t tell which, and then the other one called him an old son of a bitch<br>
    Then he says, “You wanna see something really funny?” I said “That all depends, what’ll it cost me?”<br>
    He says, “Nothin, just a minute of your time,” I say, “Alright, well that ought to be just fine,”</p>
 
    <p>He says, “Ask this fine young handsome gentleman,” and he’s pointing to the guy standing right across from him,<br>
    He says, “Ask him to tell you about that other fella, the one there sittin on the other side of ya,”<br>
    So I say, “Why? What for? What’ll happen?” he says, “Nothing probably,” and he starts laughin<br>
    I say, “I don’t get it,” he says, “Well I can see I’m borin ya, just don’t try telling me that I didn’t warn ya</p>
    
    <p>And then the phone rings and he walks off somewhere…</p>

    <p>So for a minute I paused, I just sat there drinkin, nobody’s talking and so I started thinking<br>
    I mean, what in the heck could be so hilarious about these two fellas, he can’t be serious<br>
    So I’m drinking, feeling a buzz, I ask the man to my right what his name was<br>
    He says “I’m Jake,” I said, “And who’s your brother?” He says, “For that you’re gonna have to ask my mother,”</p>
    
    <p>I said, “Alright, and where’s she?” he says he doesn’t know, points down the bar, says “My brother might, though,”<br>
    I said, “Alright, well this is getting exhausting,” So I go up to his brother and I practically accost him,<br>
    I say, “Howdy friend, putter there! Now what can you tell me bout that man down there?”<br>
    Well he shrugs some, and turns his back, he’s pouring out shots, knockin em back</p>

    <p>So I try again, I always been persistent, he resists me again, like he’s all against it<br>
    Finally the tender calls out, “Naw man, you can’t force it!—I know he drinks it faster than he pours it<br>
    But you just let him finish that there swaller, and you’ll see, he’ll begin to holler—”<br>
    Sure enough, no sooner had he set down his glass, he says: “Alright, I’ll tell you, but just cause you asked:<br>
    
    <p>He’s a no good long haired dirty yella double crossin son of a low-down lyin

    <h2>Ain't It a Pity?</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I went down to the chapel last easter morning,<br>
    Hadn’t been for a while, it seemed like a good time<br>
    I was counting on hearing a beautiful sermon<br>
    By the preacher there who’s an old friend of mine</p>
 
    <p>I’s a few minutes late, the service was crowded<br>
    An usher escorted me into my seat<br>
    Soon as I had sat down the sermon had started,<br>
    The next thing that I knew, I had fell fast asleep</p>
 
    <p>And while I was sleepin while the preacher was preachin<br>
    A most peculiar vision visited me<br>
    I dreamt that the person sittin beside me<br>
    Was none other than jesus of old galilee</p>
 
    <p>Well he put out his hand, and he said, “Nice to meet you,”<br>
    There wasn’t no halo hangin over his head<br>
    He looked old and tired and he smelled sorta pungent<br>
    As you’d imagine a man who just came back from the dead</p>
 
    <p>He wanted to know if I’d show him around some<br>
    And keep him a secret, he didn’t want to be seen<br>
    I agreed to his terms and he asked what the date was<br>
    I said, “It’s easter Sunday, 2014”</p>
 
    <p>It occurred to me then just what jesus was in for<br>
    Having never set foot within our day and age<br>
    He’d probably never seen a car or an airplane<br>
    Or watched a television or read the sportspage</p>
 
    <p>Well out of the church we two then proceeded<br>
    While the preacher in the pulpit was left carryin on<br>
    I asked old jesus what he thought of the sermon<br>
    He said he thought it had gone on too long</p>
 
    <p>We stepped outside into the city<br>
    Where the wind blew a newspaper right up to our feet<br>
    Jesus picked it up and he started to readin,<br>
    And the words that he said, he was bound to repeat, he said:</p>
 
    <p>Aint it a pity? Aint it a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    There’s still wars bein fought, there’s still people in chains<br>
    Aint it a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>Well we walked for a while through the slums and the alleys<br>
    Jesus took it all in like he’d seen it before<br>
    Healing the sick, feeding the hungry<br>
    Helping the needy, the grievin, the poor</p>
 
    <p>Somehow or other we made it to wall-street<br>
    Where we stood out like bums at a rich folks’ parade<br>
    Jesus pulled on the coat-tails of a shiny tuxedo<br>
    Asked the fella who wore it how his money was made</p>
 
    <p>Well the fella turned red and told us to get lost<br>
    He said, “That’s my business and none of your own!”<br>
    He said, “If I had a dollar to give every beggar<br>
    I’d be out of a job and out of a home!” Jesus said,</p>
 
    <p>Aint that a pity? Aint that a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    Sure the buildings are taller, but the people’s the same<br>
    Ain’t that a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>While jesus was talkin, the man lets out a whistle<br>
    And up comes this officer lookin servile and all<br>
    He says “What’s the trouble?” and the man points right at us<br>
    The officer makes us put our hands on the wall</p>
 
    <p>And while he is friskin, jesus starts talkin<br>
    Says, “You won’t get to heaven by buyin your way!”<br>
    When the officer heard that he started to beat him<br>
    Dragged us both to his squad car to haul us away</p>
 
    <p>Down at the courthouse they questioned and searched us<br>
    Took prints of our fingers and asked us our names<br>
    When I told them mine, they didn’t say nothing<br>
    When jesus said his, well they called him insane, jesus said,</p>
 
    <p>Aint that a pity? Aint that a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    To the people in charge the truth still sounds insane<br>
    Aint that a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>Well we went fore the judge who asked what our crime was,<br>
    The officer said we’s tryin to steal from the rich<br>
    He said he’d be doin both us a favor<br>
    Brought down his gavel, said the sentence was death, jesus said,</p>
 
    <p>Aint that a pity? Aint that a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    They kill you once, if you come back, they’ll kill you again<br>
    Aint that a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>Well when I awoke I was still in the chapel<br>
    The sermon was over, everyone had gone home<br>
    Except for one person way up in the front row<br>
    Who had his head bent and was prayin alone</p>
 
    <p>Well I got up to leave so as not to disturb him<br>
    I tried to be quiet so I wouldn’t be heard<br>
    But when I got to the front, and started to pass him<br>
    I couldn’t help overhearing some familiar words</p>
 
    <p>Aint it a pity? Aint it a shame?<br>
    It’s been two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed!<br>
    When I think of the violence that’s been done in christ’s name<br>
    Aint it a pitiful shame?</p>

    <h2>You Can't Get Any Poorer Than Dead</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Rich folks get—richer and richer<br>
    Sick folks get—sicker and sicker<br>
    And the gap between em gets—bigger and bigger<br>
    And the days go by—quicker and quicker</p>
    And everybody dies—sooner or later<br>
    Nobody comes out ahead<br>
    If you can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    You can’t be any poorer than dead<br>

    <p>Hired on Monday Tuesday I’m fired<br>
    Rent keeps getting higher and higher<br>
    Money keeps getting scarcer and scarcer<br>
    While my pantry keeps getting barer and barer<br>
    Somebody mustve made an error somewhere<br>
    Cause my own kids I can’t keep fed<br>
    I gotta remind em when they tell me they’re hungry <br>
    That you cant be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>

    <p>I tried to hide it but I guess its apparent<br>
    Nothing for my kids to hand down from my parents<br>
    Nothing to lose or to gain as inheritance<br>
    Save for maybe a hatred of arrogance<br>
    Last week I made out my last will and testament <br>
    And golly do you know what it said<br>
    It said you can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    And you can’t be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>
    
    <p>Population keeps increasing<br>
    Earth’s resources are near depletion<br>
    Our furthest limits we’re near to reachin<br>
    And the brakes of progress are hardly screechin<br>
    In a schoolhouse somewhere a teacher’s teachin<br>
    This is the observable trend<br>
    You can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive <br>
    And you can’t be any poorer than dead<br>

    <p>Chorus</p>

    <p>World is getting warmer and warmer<br>
    Soon it’ll be perpetual summer<br>
    With an ice-cube salesman on every corner<br>
    Sellin ice cubes at a hundred and a quarter<br>
    And I’ll take ten tho I can’t afford em<br>
    But what’s just a little more debt?<br>
    When you cant be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    You cant be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>
    
    <p>Scientists are workin harder and harder<br>
    To make machines that’re smarter and smarter<br>
    That can kill more people cheaper and faster<br>
    That’ll lead us right to nuclear disaster<br>
    Everybody thinks that it’s power he’s after<br>
    Cause everybody wants to forget<br>
    That you can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    And you can’t be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>When your employer works you harder than you’re paid to<br> 
    And you can’t ask for a raise cause you’re afraid to<br>
    And your money can’t be spent on anything except the rent<br>

    Don’t you flinch or hesitate<br>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Early one morning, the whole world fast asleep<br>
    A hobo was layin out dead in the street<br>
    Like a prayer left unanswered, a call left undailed<br>
    He was nobody’s darling, but he was somebody’s child</p>

    <p>Had a thirst keen on whisky, but he always was blunt<br>
    Never had any money, always said so up front<br>
    What’ll it be, dad—the barkeep’d ask with a smile<br>
    “I ain’t nobody’s father—I’m just somebody’s child,”</p>

    <p>He’d sleep on park-benches when he was down on his luck<br>
    And he’d ask for spare quarters when he was hard up<br>
    But he never liked hand-outs and he always desired<br>
    To be treated decent, like somebody’s child</p>
 
    <p>With his hands on a bottle, as if in a pose<br>
    Near a mountain of garbage, he’d sat down and froze<br>
    For months he just sat there, preserved, undefiled<br>
    But even an old man’s still somebody’s child</p>
 
    <p>The leaves changed their colors and the weather turned raw<br>
    And the rain fell in sheets by gravity’s law<br>
    while the snowflakes fell softly, so delicately piled<br>
    they covered the body of somebody’s child</p>
 
    <p>The people walked by him, and some of them stared<br>
    Some threw out their pennies, but nobody cared<br>
    But where is there refuge for the city’s exiled?<br>
    Show me where is the person that ain’t somebody’s child?</p>
 
    <p>Not a family to speak of, he didn’t have no home<br>
    Midst the crowds of the city, he was all alone<br>
    The name that the coroner wrote down and filed<br>
    In the absence of any was “somebody’s child,”</p>
 
    <p>Some folks’re lucky—they’re born into it all<br>
    Some come out fighting with their backs gainst the wall<br>
    Some grow more civil, other’s just get wild<br>
    But everyone starts out bein somebody’s child.</p>

    <p>Everybody knows that slavery ended with the civil war<br> 
    Equality and freedom were well worth dyin for<br>
    And people claim that race is not an issue anymore<br>
    But of whites to blacks in prison the ratio’s now one to four<br>
    but if you ain’t pale and privileged, it’s hard to ignore<br>
    And everybody knows the story of how we won our civil rights<br>
    The blacks received the ballot, the same as the whites<br>
    We ended segregation and all appeared to be alright<br>
    But the dawn of a new era just brought on another night</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case, my friend<br>
    Its black and its white, time and again<br>
    As crime rates continue to slow and descend<br>
    <s>“but we’re vanquishing crime,” the politicians contend</s><br>
    Meanwhile prison population just grows<br>
    <s>And it ain’t cause the times haven’t changed</s><br>
    <s>The more they have, the more they’ve just stayed the same</s><br>
    <s>But you never call things by their names—under the new jim crow</s><br>
    But crime ain’t the thing being fought<br>
    Despite what you’ve been told and taught<br>
    You can’t prove innocence when you’re caught—under the new jim crow</p>
 
    <p>That the US polices all the world I’ve heard it’s leaders claim<br>
    Incarcerationally speaking the US puts the world to shame<br>
    Using words of law and order, from seeming racist they’ve abstained<br>
    But slavery ain’t abolished, it’s just wearing a new name<br>
    It’d be hard to gage or guess how far the justice system’s failed<br>
    When millions of people in this free country have been jailed<br>
    Beneath the pretense of a war on crime, the cracking down’s entailed<br>
    A round-up of the ones without the means to pay the bail</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case my friends,<br>
    It’s black and it’s white, time and again<br>
    The pattern by nows a predictable trend<br>
    Whose numbers just go to show<br>
    that justice is still just a dream<br>
    Except for the whites with the means<br>
    That’s all that equality means—under the new jim crow<br>
    <s>That you can’t blame the blind hand of fate</s><br>
    <s>When the criminal is yours to create</s><br>
    <s>And is judged less by his deeds than his traits—Under the new jim crow</s></p>
 
    <p>When it’s expected that young poor black males will likelier serve time<br>
    Than receive their due diplomas in their graduation lines<br>
    And the judges in the courtrooms all claim they’re colorblind<br>
    While from the schoolyard to the jailyard there’s no black child left behind<br>
    And once you’ve been to prison, the lifelong label you will wear<br>
    But you know it will prevent you from ever getting anywhere<br>
    They’ll say it’s nothing personal as they tell you to prepare<br>
    To become someone about whom nobody has to care</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case my friends<br>
    Its black and its white, time and again<br>
    The rule of the law to the accused never bends<br>
    It was broken, a long time ago—<br>
    The rights that your laws are supposed to defend<br>
    Were suspended a long time ago<br>
    But the history’s too painful to trace<br>
    And the music’s just too sad to face<br>
    And no one wants to talk about race—under the new jim crow</p> 

    <p>And some cannot believe we could be further from the track<br>
    When even the president of the united states is black<br>
    You’d think it would mean something but it’s only been an act<br>
    In the name of social progress we’ve all turned our watches back<br>
    When the police shoot the people they ought to protect<br>
    And any motion for indictment the grand jury must reject<br>
    On account of police bullets in black bodies ain’t suspect<br>
    And black children have to wear “Don’t Shoot Me” signs around their necks</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case, my friends<br>
    It’s black and its white, time and again<br>
    And whether you’re free all seems to depend<br>
    Upon which way the wind wants to blow<br>
    With one percent of your people enslaved<br>
    In this land of the free and the brave<br>
    Tell me, America, O say<br>
    Does that star spangled banner yet wave—under the new jim crow?</p>

    <h2>The Fine Print</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 9</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Well I woke up with a bit of a condition<br> 
    So I went in to consult with my physician<br>
    He told me I would need an operation<br>
    And that it just couldn’t wait</p>

    <p>He said he’d need my authorized permission<br>
    In order to proceed with an excision<br>
    Gave me papers which I signed with the conviction<br>
    That soon it would be too late</p>

    <p>The next week I was starting to feel better<br>
    That is until I got a letter<br>
    It was from hospital bill-collector<br>
    He said I owed him twenty-thousand dollars</p>

    <p>I called and said, “tell me how can this be?<br>
    I’m being overcharged exorbitantly—<br>
    Isn’t my insurance going to front me?<br>
    I tell you I just can’t pay!”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
    They said, “You should’ve gone ahead and read the fine print<br>
    You might’ve understood a little different<br>
    It might’ve seemed like something that it isn’t<br>
    Should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, might’ve—but you didn’t”</p>

    <p>So I went down to the bank to take a loan out<br>
    They said okay just take and fill this form out<br>
    I asked them to tell me what it all was about<br>
    They said it’s just S.O.P.</p>

    <p>They asked me what I needed all that cash for<br>
    I told them that I had to pay my doctor<br>
    they told me that my income was a factor<br>
    and did I have a full-time job</p>

    <p>I told them at the moment I did not yet<br>
    my doctor said I’d have to wait a while yet<br>
    I couldn’t work until my bones were all set<br>
    The banker-lady said: No Dice.</p>
 
    <p>they said I’d need a record of some credit<br>
    Without which I might as well forget it<br>
    they said its in the contract and I read it<br>
    and they pointed at my signature</p>
 
    <p>I said “a man is not all he endorses”<br>
    They said, wait just a minute, hold your horses<br>
    They said the catch about this all, of course, is<br>
    That your interest starts today</p>
 
    <p>chorus</p>
 
    <p>So then I went out seeking some employment<br>
    Which you will imagine brought me no enjoyment<br>
    I applied without discretion or discernment<br>
    For any and everything</p>
 
    <p>I got a job working at a factry<br>
    Worked there two full weeks and then they sacked me<br>
    Told me they’d do better if they lacked me<br>
    I said what about my two-weeks pay?</p>
 
    <p>They pulled me out a crumpled piece of paper<br>
    they said I signed it: didn’t I remember?<br>
    they read me off my driver’s license number<br>
    Said I’d be getting none from them</p>
 
    <p>They said that in my contract there’s a section<br>
    Where they reserved the right to termination<br>
    Any day or time or place for any reason<br>
    And to withhold pay</p>
 
    <p>chorus</p>
 
    <p>well, I decided this was an injustice<br>
    a situation legal action must fix<br>
    so I got myself a lawyer on the off-chance<br>
    that things could be resolved</p>
 
    <p>I wrote up a complaint and a proposal<br>
    An amount for which I’d be willing to settle<br>
    They laughed and said that it would go to trial<br>
    And that I was bound to lose</p>
 
    <p>My lawyer showed a fierce determination<br>
    To stand up against the corporation<br>
    And would not be swayed by their intimidation<br>
    No matter how they tried</p>
 
    <p>Well after the judge and jury heard it<br>
    They came up with the following verdict<br>
    they said they didn’t quite know how to word it<br>
    except to say that I had lost</p>
 
    <p>My lawyer declared it was an outrage<br>
    But even so it wouldn’t make the front page<br>
    He said “another worker’s robbed of his wage—<br>
    It happens every single day.”</p>
 
    <p>Then he sincerely gave me condolences<br>
    And handed me a bill of his expenses<br>
    I asked him if he’d gone and lost his senses<br>
    What did he expect me to do?</p>
 
    <p>I thought that if we lost I owed him zero<br>
    He said that’s just in cases of pro bono<br>
    He said that “in the contract…” I said “oh no—<br>
    Here we go again,”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t aim to keep you people guessin<br>
    About the moral of this story, or the lesson<br>
    The only thing I aim to be suggestin<br>
    Is to keep your eyes open wide</p>

    <p>The next time that you go to see a lawyer<br>
    Or a banker or a doctor or employer<br>
    Or anyone who claims that they’ve got your<br>
    Best interest at heart</p>
 
    <p>Make sure you bring along your readin glasses<br>
    Make sure you dot the I’s and note the dashes<br>
    Of everything that your signature passes<br>
    And make a copy for your files</p>

    <h2>Song for the Unsung</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>This is the song for the unsung heroes<br> 
    For the losers and zeroes no history records<br>
    For the plain and blameless quiet nameless<br>
    Many who never stray too far from the shore<br> 
    Who work their hardest for no one’s notice<br>
    Who earn their money but have to steal their rest<br>
    Who lose their chances at the cheap salvation<br>
    As they fall far short of ever being second best</p>

    <p>You daily grinders and watch-spring winders<br>
    Hopeless reminders of what all you might have been<br>
    I salute you in all your strivings<br>
    Remember there are more of you than them</p>
 
    <p>This is the song for the ordinary sister<br>
    Of the beauty contest winner with the recessive traits<br>
    Whom no one stares at or asks to dinner<br>
    Or invites out dancing or wants to date<br>
    Who grows to old age and never marries<br>
    Who has no children to call her very own<br>
    But who gives her love out to all who’ll take it<br>
    And is, wherever she is, right at home</p>

    <p>This is the song for the unknown soldier<br>
    Who grew no bolder the nearer war he got<br>
    Who aimed his rifle for his own survival<br>
    At his would-be enemy but never took the shot<br>
    Who died in battle, came home like chattel,<br>
    Was laid to rest in an unmarked pauper’s grave<br>
    Was unremembered save as young and foolish<br>
    And by a few who knew him as less than brave</p>

    <p>You adventure seekers, timid time-keepers<br>
    Who watch the bleachers from the middle of the fray<br>
    As you go headlong into unknown country<br>
    May God bless and keep you safe upon your way</p>
 
    <p>This is the song for the obscure explorer<br>
    Who winds up poorer than when he started out<br>
    Who never arrives at his destination<br>
    Whose explanation the world must do without<br>
    Who will lose his compass, his only atlas<br>
    Whose tears of madness will ingredient the sea<br>
    As the waves that pound him will lift and drown him<br>
    With his question sounding: will anyone remember me?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 11</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>You billionaires in your big easy chairs<br>
    counting your coins and your dough<br>
    What do you need with all that money?<br>
    You can’t take it with you, you know</p>
 
    <p>You’ve hedged all your bets, you’ve become a success,<br>
    your kingdom spreads out far and wide<br>
    but when will your stuff ever bring you enough?<br>
    When will you be satisfied?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
    When pigs learn to fly, when hell freezes o’er<br>
    When the rocks in the mountains can sing<br>
    But just cause they don’t, it don’t mean that they won’t<br>
    There’s a first time for everything</p>
 
    <p>You big-business bosses who cut all your losses<br>
    Who pay less than the minimum wage<br>
    Whose labor’s on lease somewheres overseas<br>
    Cause it’s cheaper and all of the rage</p>

    <p>What will you say to folks comin your way<br>
    When outside your door they are packed<br>
    Screamin for work and callin you jerk<br>
    Sayin, “When can we have our jobs back?”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now the healthcare debate in the united states<br>
    Is as fierce as it is anywhere<br>
    When the state of your health depends on your wealth<br>
    That don’t exactly seem fair</p>
 
    <p>I need to be cured, but I ain’t insured<br>
    It’s the most I can do just to beg<br>
    When will I receive the care that I need<br>
    Without payin an arm and a leg?</p>
 
    <p>chorus</p>
 
    <p>You judges who sit, who condemn and acquit<br>
    Who hear bout the worst that men do<br>
    Aloft in your towers with your gowns and your powers<br>
    Who gets to pass judgment on you?</p>
 
    <p>You’ll seal a man’s fate to be killed by the state<br>
    You’ll kill thinking your doing what’s best<br>
    But when will a man’s life be too high a price<br>
    To weigh in the scales against death?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now the world is at war over oil and ore<br>
    Over power and territory<br>
    Over whose God is in charge and whose is not<br>
    On that point no one can agree</p>
 
    <p>Meanwhile bombs descend on women and children<br>
    When O when will it cease?<br>
    When will the fight desist for the night<br>
    When will the world live in peace?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now perhaps I’m naieve, as green as the leaves<br>
    That sprout on the trees in the spring<br>
    Maybe I’m touched to be thinking so much<br>
    We all know what wishin can bring</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps I’m a dope to hope without hope<br>
    But there’s one thing that I’ve always known<br>
    If you want things to improve, well you gotta move<br>
    Cause they ain’t gonna change on their own</p>
 
    <p>So get yourself wise and get organized<br>
    Lift up your voices and sing<br>
    Cause if you don’t, they probably wont<br>
    There’s a last time for everything</p>

    <h2>Where My Yard Used to Be (There's an Oil Field There)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 12</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>This morning I woke to the sound of a blast<br>
    “Who’s there? Who’s there? Who is it?” I asked<br>
    A man was outside wearing some kind of mask<br>
    Said he was with Halliburton Oil and Gas</p>
 
    <p>He gave me a paper which he asked me to sign<br>
    What is it? I asked him, he said, “Nevermind,”<br>
    Said if I just put my name down on yon dotted line<br>
    Ten thousand dollars could be instantly mine</p>
 
    <p>I was still a bit groggy but it sounded alright to me<br>
    I signed his paper and I went back to sleep<br>
    And when I awoke I wanted to shriek<br>
    They drilled a hole on my property 10,000 feet deep</p>
 
    <p>Now where my yard used to be there’s an oil field there<br>
    They tell me I signed it away fair and square<br>
    But now I can’t drink my water and I can’t breathe my air<br>
    Please Mr. Gas-man, is it just that you don’t know what you’re doing—or that you don’t care?</p>
 
    <p>Well I made several inquiries and asked for a report<br>
    About this hydraulic fracturing, or fracking for short<br>
    And when I tried to protest, to make them cease and abort<br>
    They laughed and just told me they’d see me in court</p>
 
    <p>Shortly thereafter I realized my mistake<br>
    When they turned my pond into a gasoline lake<br>
    I wish someone had told me bout the risk I would take<br>
    That the losses would outweigh the money I’d make</p>
 
    <p>Now oil companies claim that its cheap, and what’s more<br>
    we don’t have to rely on foreign oil anymore<br>
    but as time passes by you can’t fail to ignore<br>
    that gas is two bucks a gallon, but now fresh-water costs four</p>
 
    <p>and where my fields used to be, there’s an oil-field there<br>
    and where my woods used to be, there’s an oil-field there<br>
    and you can’t drink the water and you can’t breathe the air<br>
    Please Mr. Gas-man, is it just that you don’t know what you’re doing—or that you don’t care?</p>
 
    <p>and if you’re inclined to think it ain’t as bad as it sounds<br>
    you ought to check on the chemicals they’re putting into your ground<br>
    ethyl-methyls, and sulfates, in lethal amounts<br>
    plus 500 others I can’t even pronounce</p>
 
    <p>Now the trees that once grew here have all been cut down<br>
    The air, once so clean, now looks dirty and brown<br>
    the birds all flew off, the fishes all drowned<br>
    next thing you know, it’ll be me skipping town</p>
 
    <p>and tell me, what will you do when your well’s overdrawn?<br>
    When you’ve lost what you’ve built your tomorrows upon?<br>
    When you finally realize all along you’ve been wrong?<br>
    Tell me where will you go when our planet is gone?</p>
 
    <p>When, where the earth used to be, there’s an oil-field there?<br>
    When you finally realize that you haven’t a spare?<br>
    I’ll ask you in hope, and I’ll plea in despair:<br>
    Please Mr. Gas-man, is it just that you don’t know what you’re doing—or that you don’t care?</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t know about you, what your tomorrows are worth<br>
    If you think it’ll get better before it gets worse<br>
    But when you damage the planet, everyone hurts<br>
    And you’re killing the future by destroying the earth</p>

    <p>Now the gas and oil companies are rolling in wealth<br>
    But they need your permission to keep spreading their filth<br>
    So if they ask, in the interest of keeping your health,<br>
    Say: you can’t frack my land, you can go frack yourself!</p>

    If I told you I loved you and sang about it—would you love me then?<br>
    If I had influence, title, rank, or position<br>
    If I changed my name, my race, my religion<br>
    If I told you I was eager to hear your decision—would you love me then?<br>
     If I promised to leave you alone forever—would you love me then?<br>
    If I told you we didn’t have to be together—would you love me then?<br>
    If I took your advice, your offered suggestion<br>
    If I swore I wouldn’t make any public confession<br>
    If I promised not to ask you anymore questions—mm, would you love me then?    </p>

    <p>If the sun tomorrow should rise and find me gone from your side<br>
    If my life should transpire so quick as to fit to within the blink of an eye<br>
    If all of the dust of my days should be scattered in ten different ways<br>
    And the ocean complains that nothing remains to answer the one who asks why<br>

    If all of my cries should fall short of the home t’where they fly<br>
    If they shatter and break on the walls of the gate that proves too strong and too high<br>
    If word of me never returns, and my whereabouts never get learned<br>

    <h2>Tell Me Something I Don't Already Know</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>At Least There Will Be Love, 2016</i> Track 3</h4>

    <p>You woke me with a question from your distant past you said it was not urgent but it would require some attention soon<br>
I followed up by askin what you meant by that but this was later some time long after you had already left the room<br>
The times we’ve tried have not been few, although communication has perhaps at times been rare<br>
And tho I’ve said, it’s up to you, it’s clear to me that you’d prefer that it remain unshared<br>
            And that’s alright, if that’s your style<br>
            You’ve got that right, you’re not on trial<br>
            I’d appreciate it if the next time tho<br>
            You’d tell me something that I don’t already know<br>
I recall that you returned to me, eventually, with an apology you said you couldn’t write but had to say to me<br>
That spoke of things that never were, that tried to be, that might have been perhaps if only it hadn’t been for me<br>
You called me names, suggested lies, pretended I had only been your enemy<br>
You said, “Love is born, it lives and dies, and people change and are a challenge to their destiny—”<br>
            And you’re not wrong, that’s not quite it<br>
            Cause you don’t belong with me I’ll admit<br>
            But the next time that you come to say you have to go<br>
            Tell me something that I don’t already know<br>
 We’ve covered all this ground before, there’s nothing new to speak of with regards to where it leaves us, where we must remain<br>
I know you’ll go on hoping I’m a wound to you while I’ll go back to dreaming at the drawingboard, my windowpane<br>
And all that’s left of all that was in me will linger faintly as a residue<br>
And looking down, from up above, perhaps at last you’ll catch the contrast in our points of view<br>
             But if you don’t because you choose<br>
            And say you won’t because you’d lose<br>
            The chance to tell the mighty that they’ve fallen low<br>
            Well tell me something that I don’t already know</p>

    <p>Sky’s gone cloudy and the sun’s been dim<br>
    It seems the stars these days are always late<br>
    And it won’t be long now fore the rain sets in<br>
    But all there is to do is wait<br>
     Please take my picture when you go from here<br>
    As it will help me not to feel so far from you<br>
    And I’ll try less often to wish you near<br>
    When, or rather, if, I do<br>
                And if I should survive, as I think I probly will<br>
                As I only ever have before<br>
                It will not be because of me<br>
                It will be because you know I’m yours<br>
    I watched your shadow as you weaved the loom<br>
    Your clothing lay draped over the chairs<br>
    A Casanova with a pink balloon<br>
    Waiting like a child on the stairs<br>
    Please take me with you when you go from here<br>
    As it will help me not to feel so far from you<br>
    And I’ll try less often to feel the fear<br>
    If, or rather, when, I do<br>
                And if I should survive as I think I will,<br>
                As I only ever have before<br>
                It will not be because of me<br>
                It will be because you know I’m yours    </p>

    <p>Shes the sun at dawn, shes a dream you drawn<br>
    She’s a train you’ll chase forever that don’t never let you on<br>
    She’s beautiful, she’s both hands full<br>
    She’s cautious as a fledgling calf, and fragile as a fawn<br>
     She knows her bounds and your hopes she’ll drown<br>
    Her eyes are like the well you cast your lonesome wishes down<br>
    She’s a misplayed chord, she’s a two-edged sword<br>
    She’s a bird that’s fallen that never even left the ground<br>
                 She cant be held, contained nor quelled<br>
                And she don’t reside even where she says she’s dwelled<br>
                She ain’t coming soon, but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love<br>
     She’s a ragin tide, downright dignified<br>
    A wildfire wadin through a callow countryside<br>
    She’s my favorite song, my whole life long<br>
    She’s the failure I was faced with every single time I tried<br>
     She’s a waving flag, she’s a boundin stag<br>
    Free as a feather floating down a canyon crag<br>
    She’s a broken soul, she’s a lost-sheep’s wool<br>
    She’s a priceless linen mixed-in with a beggar’s bandage rag<br>
                 She can’t be reached through spoken speech <br>
                And she breathes in vapors near the boundary’s breach<br>
                She ain’t comin soon but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love<br>
     She’s a quiet smirk, she’s full of quirk<br>
    She’s like ivy growin upwards through the garden lattic-work<br>
    Her voice is sure, and her heart is pure<br>
    She’s a soothing salve for every wound you’ve got that’s hurt<br>
    She’s full of tricks, she’s too fair to fix<br>
    She’s a churchmouse crawling cross the crucifix<br>
    She’s a wisp of smoke, she’s a wooden spoke<br>
    She’s a spur upon a bootheel that’s never learned to kick<br>
                 She can’t be caught, revealed nor wrought<br>
                She’s a matter of fact, upon a second thought<br>
                She ain’t coming soon, but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love<br>
     She’s a friendly face, she’s a saving grace<br>
    She’s a trap-door hinged upon a hiding place<br>
    She’s a standing cliff, she’s a hieroglyph<br>
    She’s a strong defense that doesn’t have no case<br>
     She’s a windin brook, she’s a chance that’s took<br>
    She’s the same old story in a brand new book<br>
    She’s an ocean wave, she’s a shallow grave<br>
    She’s the knight that left the bishop to defend the rook<br>
                 She can’t be known, can’t be left alone<br>
                She is my journey, my friend, my home<br>
                She ain’t coming soon, but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love    </p>

    <p>I must be cursed; the fates must be against me<br>
    She’s taken no interest; she can’t even sense me<br>
    I’m a face in a crowd that’s well neath her status,<br>
    That’s an audience to her, that she’ll never notice<br>
                She don’t even know me, but that ain’t the problem<br>
                The one thing we share’s having nothing in common<br>
                A stranger with whom I wish I were familiar<br>
                If only so that I could finally tell her</p>
                            <p>That I’m helplessly, hopelessly, endlessly,  openly,<br>
                            Neverthelessly in love with you<br>
                            Brokenly, quietly, quite unrequitedly<br>
                            Somehow inspite of me, in love with you</p>
    <p>I’m boundless and depthless and restless and breathless<br>
                And it’d be a short list to name what I wouldn’t do<br>
                To show you how sweetly, how madly, completely,<br>
                How badly, how deeply, I’m in love with you<br>
    Whenever she’s near, I can feel my pulse racing<br>
    Every minute she’s gone feels like time I’m just wasting<br>
    To somebody’s dreams she must be the native<br>
    But she’s just in my world—I’m not that creative<br>
                If I could imagine her daily and nightly<br>
                And all on my own, however unlikely<br>
                I’d probably need never roam any further<br>
                There’d be no cause to alarm or alert her</p>
                            <p>That I’m visibly, viably, undeniably<br>
                            Certifiably in love with you<br>
                            Joylessly, lucklessly, sorely, reluctantly,<br>
                            It’s not even up to me, in  love with you</p>
    <p>I’m weary and woeful, I’m inconsolable<br>
                And from the depths of my own soul I wish it weren’t true<br>
                But I’m clinically, cynically, consciously, critically<br>
                Admittedly—in love with you    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#atLeastThereWillBeLove_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I looked all round the world for a love of my own<br>
    Now I’ve been everywhere and I’m still all alone<br>
    Just when I started thinking true love can’t be found<br>
    Who but I should start falling when who but you turns around</p>
                <p>When I said that it takes time for new love to bloom<br>
                It might be that I might’ve spoke a little too soon<br>
                You know what they say, it ain’t good to presume<br>
                It might be that I might’ve spoke a little too soon</p>
    <p>Well the first thing you told me is that youd be all mine<br>
    Next thing I know I’m half out of my mind<br>
    Feel like running and hiding, feel like walking right out<br>
    You say you just want to know what I’ve been thinking about</p>
                <p>When I said as long as I had you I would never be doomed<br>
                Well it might be that I might have spoke a little too soon</p>
                <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>I know how to want you just as well as the next<br>
    Its remaining happy once you’re mine I don’t get<br>
    I know that you told me I was all out of tries<br>
    But that you weren’t kidding I guess I didn’t quite realize</p>
                <p>When I said that nobody’d ever make me change my own tune<br>
                Well it might be that I might’ve spoke a little too soon</p>
                <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>When I told you I loved you unconditionally<br>
    I was under the impression you felt the same way about me<br>
    When I asked if you wanted to come be my wife<br>
    I thought it meant that I would be the only man in your life</p>
                <p>But you got one in the stairwell and one up in your room<br>
                Well it might be that I might have spoke a little too soon</p>
                 <p>Chorus</p>

    <p>Bout the hour the sun goes down, I get to thinking of leaving town<br>
    The trains and traffic they make their sounds, a blood within me begins to pound<br>
    She calls to tell me she’s on her way, she knows I get round that time of day<br>
    Feeling like I’d be stuck to stay, better off just a goin way</p>
                <p>I feel my feet start to leave the ground<br>
                I step away and I’m fallin down<br>
                I feel your arms they’re around me now<br>
                But tell me, babe, do you have me, now?<br>
                 I’m hardly home and I’m highway bound<br>
                I’m known to run at the smallest sound<br>
                I’m known to hide where I won’t be found<br>
                So tell me, babe, do you have me, now?</p>
    <p>Lifted out of the mangled mess, I’m back out on the top, I guess<br>
    Just wrestling the restlessness, I won’t win but I’ll do my best<br>
    She’s sturdy as frozen stone, does alright when she’s on her own<br>
    The kindest of the kind of known, the closest I’ve ever been to home</p>
                <p>I think I’d live if she left me now<br>
                And if I left would I be allowed<br>
                I could love if you’d show me how<br>
                But tell me, babe, do you have me now?<br>
                 I feel your kisses against my brow<br>
                I hear you say that we should and shall<br>
                I hear you say you don’t need no vow<br>
                But tell me babe do you have me now?</p>
    <p>She keeps me close and she holds me tight, walks me through each and every night<br>
    She ain’t afraid to put up a fight, makes it seem like it’ll be alright<br>
    But in the morning she leaves again, and tho she says she’ll come back again<br>
    And tho I tell her I’ll see her then, I always hope I’ll still be here then</p>
                <p>I spread my wings and she holds me down<br>
                I try to swim and she helps me drown<br>
                I start to cry and she calls me clown<br>
                But tell me babe do you have me now?<br>
                 Cause I can fly without leavin ground<br>
                And I can dive without goin down<br>
                And I can kid without foolin round<br>
                So tell me babe do you have me now?</p>
    <p>About a mile down the railroad track, I get to thinking of thinkin back<br>
    I wonder if she would take me back, if she knew I was comin back<br>
    Left a note in her dresser drawer, sayin how I just wasn’t sure<br>
    Sayin how I would lock the door, but not to wait up for me no more</p>
                <p>Tell me babe, would you have me now?<br>
                Now that you know that I’m broken down?<br>
                Now that you know I don’t wear no crown?<br>
                Now that you know I won’t stick around?<br>
                 Tell me babe do you have me now?<br>
                Now that I’m somewhere behind you now?<br>
                Now that at least I can’t hurt you now?<br>
                Now that I can’t desert you now?</p>

    <p>She may not even remember me now, it was so long ago<br>
    I recall when she left it was winter again, her footprints had trailed in the snow<br>
    And when spring came around they had melted away and by then I had learned to forget<br>
    That it wasn’t because she didn’t love me enough that she had been so upset<br>
                And I know it don’t do nobody no good to say it now after all this time<br>
                But it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but mine</p>

    <p>There’ve been so many others since her, but she was the first<br>
    And maybe it’s just cause I loved her the most, that losing her hurt the worst<br>
    And maybe I am still just holding on cause I’m lonesome with everyone else<br>
    And maybe I only want her back cause I’m so tired of myself <br>
                But whatever it is that’s causing all this, there’s one thing to which I’m resigned<br>
                It’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but mine</p>

    <p>This morning I found an old letter of hers in my desk’s bottom drawer<br>
    It contained a long list of things that she missed about me and loved me for<br>
    At the end of the note she apparently wrote I will always love only you<br>
    And after all of these years what makes me afeared is thinking that it might still be true<br>
                I wish I could say I was sorry now, how could I have been so blind<br>
                But it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but mine</p>

    <p>Now as I sit here in familiar solitude, unvisited even by noise<br>
    I like to pretend that it had to be so, that neither one of us had any choice<br>
    Its easy to feel like she did it to me, like nothing I said was believed<br>
    But sometimes the truth creeps in through the roof and says you aint lyin, you’re just self-deceived<br>
                Cause she was the one who wanted to stay, and I told her to go, now she’s gone<br>
                And its nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but my own    </p>

    <p>For all of the lies that I told<br>
    For getting away with the fast ones I pulled<br>
    Persisting, even when it got old<br>
    For leaving you standing alone in the cold<br>

                And for wrecklessly leading you on<br>

                            But for whatever it’s worth, if it has any impact, 
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For leaving it all up to fate<br>
    For devising the trap and laying the bait<br>
    For offering too little too late<br>
    For destroying the plans that you tried to create<br>
                for being the one who was never around<br>
                and accusing you of disappearing<br>
                for ruthlessly kicking you when you were down<br>
                and afterwards trying to be so endearing</p>
                            <p>The time of the day I don’t even deserve
                            But I don’t need it, I’m in no hurry<br>
                            I know that you think that I’ve sure got some nerve
                            But I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>         
    <p>for wanting you to be like you were<br>
    for acting so childish and so immature<br>
    for expecting you to be pure<br>
    and treating you like you were part of the tour<br>
                for letting you fall when you needed a hand<br>
                up from the floor you were sweeping<br>
                for pretending that I could not understand<br>
                the language in which you were speaking </p>
                            <p>I know that my efforts have not been enough
                            A gentleman I have been, hardly<br>
                            But before you go writing me entirely off
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For totally wasting your time<br>
    For being unwell, saying that I was fine<br>
    For feeding you all the old lines<br>
    For failing to make you a priority of imine<br>
                For doing the absolute least I could do<br>
                And not even without complaining<br>
                And for taking even your umbrella from you<br>
                The minute that it started raining</p>
                            <p>If you don’t ever want to see me again 
                            And if you never ans—wer me<br>
                            I’ll understand, but I might as well then
                            Tell you now fore I go—that I’m sorry</p>      
    <p>For making you miss the last train<br>
    For keeping the torch lit for an old flame<br>
    For driving you slowly insane<br>
    For making you guess instead of saying it plain<br>
                For treating this all like no more than a fling<br>
                As you asked: O why must you tease me?<br>
                And then when it came time to do the right thing<br>
                For doing instead what felt easy</p>
                            <p>I know in the past, when I’ve said this before
                            Your silences have frequently scarred me<br> 
                            I know you can’t put up with me anymore
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For utterly failing to learn<br>
    For leaving long fore the meeting adjourned <br>
    For making you wait for your turn<br>
    To be treated decent, like it was something you’d earn<br>
                For salting the wound, and fueling the flame<br>
                Adding insult to your injury<br>
                for whimpering whenever saying your name <br>
                And making sure that you heard me</p>
                            <p>Your more patient with me than anyone else 
                            I’d’ve featherd and tarred me<br>
                            But this time I ain’t gonna ask for you help
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For throwing you under the bus<br>
    For staining your pride and abusing your trust<br>
    For making you feel that you must<br>
    For ditching you in a cloud of my dust<br>
                For gorging myself, meanwhile letting you starve<br>
                like some well-wishing judas<br>
                For handing you over to the people in charge<br>
                While you kindly mistook me for Brutus </p>
                            <p>And nevermind silver, nevermind gold
                            I’d’ve done it for thirty denari<br>
                            And if it’s the last thing I ever tell to the world
                            I just want you to know—I’m sorry</p>

    <p>You been a poor wife to your husband, you been a bad mother to your child<br>
    You ain’t been much to speak of to your folks in some long while<br>
    You been something of a let-down to your whole family<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>You been bad news to your landlord ever since you signed that lease<br>
    The only visitors you get in here are either junkies or police<br>
    You been wanted for a while now, everyone’s your enemy<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>You been a disgrace to your people, you’ve exhibited no pride<br>
    When the spies came you went to them and you invited them inside<br>
    You’d be called a traitor back in your home country<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>Everybody says you’re crazy, when you look they all turn around<br>
    Nobody seems to like you much you’re just too hard to be around<br>
    That’s the same way that people talk when they’re talkin about me<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>Should your laughter turn to tears, and should your smile straighten out<br>
    Should the minutes turn to years, and your assurances to doubt<br>
    And should there be only half as much love here as you say<br>
    If you never leave the path<br>
    You tell a joke and no one laughs<br>
    If you never learn to do the math, <br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And should the ease become a strain, and should the work become a toil<br>
    And should our happiness be plain, and inseperable from soil<br>
    And should the tune become so flat which we always used to play<br>
    That the music won’t come back<br>
    We only hear it as a lack<br>
    Both because of and despite that<br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And should your looks begin to go, and should your wits begin to dim<br>
    And should your age begin to show, through the wrinkles on your skin<br>
    And should you become so old that your hair has all turned gray<br>
    When your stories have been told<br>
    And your teeth have all been pulled<br>
    And when you’re far too frail to hold<br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And when you are not here, and when I am by myself,<br>
    And when the future isn’t clear, and when you seem like someone else<br>
    I will not find you strange, nor will it be to my dismay<br>
    For in spite of how you change, <br>
    you come in and out of range<br>
    It can’t be helped, you won’t be blamed<br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And if we never aren’t poor, and if I discover that you’re flawed<br>
    And if we always aren’t sure, and leave it mostly up to God<br>
    At least there will be love, when all else has passed away<br>
    And when pushing comes to shove<br>
    When I’m no longer who I was<br>
    And when nobody else does<br>
                I will still love you anyway    </p>

    <p>Rooster’s in the henhouse with his feathers all mussed<br>
    the hay-barn is burning and the milk’s gone sour<br>
    It’s harvesting time but the whole crop’s a bust<br>
    And that’s the third thunderstrike I’ve heard in the past half-hour<br>
                Been up for three days in a drippin cold-sweat<br>
                I called for a doctor and they sent me a vet<br>
                I’m losing my livelihood along with a bet<br>
                and I ain’t even had my coffee yet</p>

    <p>the ship’s hit an ice-berg and the radio’s down<br>
    the captain’s in the crow’s nest trying to get drunk<br>
    Nero’s somewhere fiddling, and we’re all gonna drown<br>
    somebody send an S.O.S.—we’re sunk!<br>
                Throw out your preservers, cast wide your net<br>
                We gonna need all the mother-lovin luck that we can get<br>
                We’re in the middle of nowhere, and I’m all wet—<br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet</p>

    <p>Private detective’s in his best disguise<br>
    He’s already taken a few incriminating photographs<br>
    He’s got the evidence to prove whatever the defendant denies<br>
    He caught the guy with his secretary, takin a bath<br>
                A lady pulls up in her ex-husband’s corvette<br>
                As the private I.’s lighting his last cigarette<br>
                She asks if it’s done—he says, “We’re all set—<br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet”</p>

    <p>Productivity’s down, and the factory’s pinched<br>
    Management doesn’t know what to do<br>
    The union fellas won’t surrender an inch<br>
    And the strike ain’t nowhere near being through<br>
                The thing to remember is that no-one forgets<br>
                If it’s a do-or-die matter, I say “Let’s!”<br>
                Every time I answer the phone, it’s a brand new threat         <br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet</p>

    <p>Alarm clock went off first thing in the morning<br>
    Didn’t even get the paper before I heard the news<br>
    Neighbors were outside in their bathrobes quarreling<br>
    Election’s over and half the nation’s singing the blues<br>
                Sweep the confetti from your TV sets<br>
                Better call up your friends and forgive them their debts<br>
                The sun’s barely up, I’m full of regrets— <br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet       </p>

    <p>The way that an amputee misses his limb<br>
    After the doctor has sawn it from him<br>
    Leaving him only the scar of his skin<br>
    With which he must try to adapt<br>
     Or the way that an arrow that’s aimed at the heart<br>
    Of some would-be lover alone in the dark<br>
    Can near and so narrowly still miss the mark<br>
    Hitting some bystander’s back <br>
                Or the way that a jury can believe what it wants having just received all of the facts<br>
                I miss you—I miss you—I miss you—like that</p>

    <p>The way that a baby cries for the breast <br>
    Of the woman who maybe has sins to confess<br>
    Whose feeling her worst when she’s doing her best<br>
    For whom smiling’s part of the act<br>
     Or the way that a shipwreck wants to be saved <br>
    From his raft on the water where he’s drifted for days<br>
    Where he can still get a signal on his radio wave<br>
    But cannot explain where he’s at<br>
                 Or the way that a mackerel still goes for the hook, even knowing that it’s just a trap<br>
                I want you—I want you—I want you—like that</p>

    <p>The way that a parachute needs to unfold <br>
    As soon as the cord is reached for and pulled<br>
    Without which there’d be nothing else to grab hold<br>
    And no time for you to react<br>
     Or the way that a candleflame requires a wick<br>
    That isn’t too slender and isn’t too thick<br>
    If the flame isn’t going to burn out too quick<br>
    Leaving only a puddle of wax<br>
                 Or the way that an inntertube needs to be patched, or replaced when the wheel has gone flat<br>
                I need you—I need you—I need you—Like that</p>

    <p>The way that a meteor dies in its birth<br>
    Destroying itself in its fall to the earth<br>
    Whose cinder is studied, given value and worth<br>
    According to what’s left in tact<br>
     Or the way that a fine wine never expires<br>
    The way satisfaction never desires<br>
    The way I’m perpetually caught in the wires<br>
    Like some circus ring acrobat<br>
                Or the way that an answer can be extremely precise without being at all exact<br>
                I love you—I love you—I love you—like that    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Your heart is set on leaving me—What am I supposed to say?<br>
    So long, I guess the pleasure’s all been mine<br>
    There’s no sense in deceiving me—it hurts, but I’ll be okay<br>
    Wounds have a way of healing, in good time<br>
                I spose I should be thanking you, for at least giving me a try<br>
                I know that a good man is hard to find<br>
    Tell me that you’re going now, but don’t let’s say goodbye<br>
    Just in case you ever change your mind—</p>

    <p>I wouldn’t want to influence—your sterling wherewithal<br>
    Nobody knows you better than yourself<br>
    I wouldn’t know just what to do with a splintered crystal ball<br>
    But what good’s it doing resting on your shelf?<br>
                You were burning in your eagerness, too confident to fail<br>
                And yet the humor in the gloom you couldn’t find<br>
    So I’ll put my house in order and blaze you out a trail<br>
    Just in case you ever change your mind</p>

    <p>Sometimes, when it begins to rain, I think of how we met<br>
    You called me by some name that wasn’t mine<br>
    and then, as you explained to me that you meant no disrespect<br>
    you hinted that perhaps it was a sign—<br>
                It seems like only yesterday, I remember it so clear <br>
                It felt as though the planets had aligned<br>
    Well, Fare thee well, and take good care; if you need me, I’ll be here—<br>
    Just in case you ever change your mind</p>

    <p>The gavel’s fell like pistol shots, the jury has come in<br>
    At some verdict it’s presumed they have arrived<br>
    But nevermind the circumstance; we both know where we’ve been <br>
    Our love was just some trial we survived<br>
                With the option to be merciful, you clung on to your grudge<br>
                You said I was too rude, too unrefined<br>
    A wiser man than I once said “Don’t be so quick to judge,<br>
    just in case you ever change your mind—”    </p>

    <h2>The Hardest Thing I Ever Done (Was Easier Than Loving You)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Words, Words, Words, 2018</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I done some things in my day that let me just say were a little less than easy to do<br>
    I been hard-pressed and hard-up on a hard-road with hard-luck, been hard-hearted one time or two<br>
    Troubles, trials, tribulations, tragedies I’ve had me a few<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you </p>

    <p>I believe I broke the record for the longest second-look<br>
    I’d have to check again, though, to see if it’s still in the Guinness book<br>
    The feat may sound incredible to some, but to me it ain’t nothing new<br>
    Cause the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you</p>

                 <p>You got a way about you babe, that just don’t know when to quit<br>
                You joined up on the losing side but defeat you just can’t admit</p>

    <p>I chose to do without them when fate offered me her jewels<br>
    I ate from the tree of knowledge knowing full well it was against the rules<br>
    I was sentenced to hard labor and now my freedom’s overdue<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n loving you</p>

    <p>I resisted false temptation when it advertised its bliss<br>
    I beat the devil at his own board-game in the wide open wilderness<br>
    I lashed myself upon the mainmast so I could hear the sirens coo<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you </p>

                <p>You got a way about you babe, you just don’t know when you’re wrong<br>
                I tell you to let go of me but you just keep on hanging on—</p>
    <p>I made wings of wax and feathers and I flapped em towards the sun<br>
    when I was still ascending the heat went ahead and melted em<br>
    as deep into the sea I sank as high above the world I flew<br>
    but the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you</p>
    <p>I climbed up Jacob’s ladder just to see what I could see<br>
    I went down into the underworld to try to set my spirit free<br>
    I held the world upon my shoulders just so Atlas could use the loo<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was eaiser’n lovin you</p>
                <p>I ain’t sayin I don’t love you, or that you ain’t worth no regard<br>
                All I’m trine to tell you babe is that sometimes lovin you is hard—</p>
    <p>I fought the famous hydra with nothing but a pocket knife<br>
    If it hadn’t been such slow going I might’ve gone and lost my life<br>
    For every head that I cut off, in its place three more grew<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you</p>
    <p>Now I’ve heard that love is patient, and I’ve heard that love is kind<br>
    I’ve heard that love hopes and bears all things; I’ve even heard that love is blind—<br>
    But when weighed in my own experience, I know this much is true:<br>
    the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Words, Words, Words, 2018</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>before the panelist of scientists I stood defending poetry<br>
    Reciting words I’d overheard  From a magician doing sorcery <br>
    falling short of proof in court  I surrendered to His Majesty<br>
    When the jester laughed, I removed his hat  As he praised me my humility<br>
                the case dismissed from consciousness  I resumed my daily alchemy<br>
                Sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—can change your destiny</p>

    <p>As battles raged—a squire’s page  Was charged with this delivery:<br>
    To spread the news his side would lose  Without help supplied immediately<br>
    On his master’s horse he wound a course  Beyond his country’s boundary<br>
    And story goes, he took to prose  And now he writes tales for posterity<br>
                          What became of the page’s name  To this day remains a mystery<br>                  
                          Sticks and stones may break your bones But words—can alter history</p>

    <p>Wind and fog and somewhere, God, At the beginning of eternity,<br>
    commandingly said, “Let there be…”  And each question became a certainty<br>
    And there was light to pierce the night  Where darkness filled each cavity<br>
    An unseen jaw dispensing law  For motion and for gravity—<br>
                And life commenced impermanence  While Death dealt with the converse<br>
                Sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—can build a universe</p>

    <p>In days of youth I longed for truth   About love especially, I was curious<br>
    But what I know now of Love’s know-how  I only learned through inexperience<br>
    Foolish tries and compromise  Convinced me love was just a hindrance<br>
    More than to win her, what I should prefer  Is to forget or return to ignorance<br>
                “He’s mad!” you’ll say, “to feel this way—”  And I’d agree with you, regrettably <br>
                Sticks and stones can break your bones  But words—can wound a man, irreparably</p>

    <p>I did my best and knew success  It seemed a painless interlude<br>
    Between two wars in which the scores  Had been irrevocably misconstrued<br>
    Once the ghosts resumed their posts  In the countries of their summoning<br>
    I spent what I’d made in the king’s parade  And departed to my homecoming<br>
                The bridges crossed, my papers were lost, tho I wouldn’t say I lack them currently<br>
                Sticks and stones can break your bones  But words—are like a currency </p>
    <p>When asked to play, I said okay  Tho in preparing, I was meticulous<br>
    And before I’d sung, the bell had rung  And I’d been announced ridiculous<br>
    And for my prize I was ostracized  And was made to sign a covenant<br>
    but once I had, I didn’t feel so bad  to entertain them would have been a punishment<br>
                And now I’ve chewed on solitude    So long it tastes like venison<br>
                Sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—can be a medicine</p>

    <p>did a so-called crime and I paid my time  Tho the offense was considered minimal<br>
    When I got released, I thought, “I’m free, at least…”  But folks still took me for a criminal<br>
    I tried and tried my past to hide  Thought I’d escape from it eventually<br>
    But people talked and my way was blocked  Now I’m back at the penitentiary<br>
                My freedom earned, my lesson learned  I’ll tell you what now, society—<br>
                That sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—shape reality    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Words, Words, Words, 2018</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The D.A.’s on the front porch with the landlord behind him<br>
    Eviction notice  has been nailed to the door<br>
    Their knocking and pounding  disrupts someone calling:<br>
    “With what can I bargain when I am so poor?” <br>
     They go in and come out  dragging a person<br>
    Old man in a bathrobe  half-naked and crine<br>
    D.A. says “I’m sorry”  but he says it smiling—<br>
    “Each man’s got his labor  and don’t I got mine?”                       <br>
                You can call it your labor to ease your conscience<br>
                Call it your duty if it’ll help you sleep tight<br>
                Call it your career if you can’t tell the difference       <br>
                But callin it your job, boss—won’t make it right<br>
     The warden’s a bastard  he’s a stickler for details<br>
    Heaven have mercy  when he makes his patrol<br>
    If he finds so much as  a sheet that’s been wrinkled<br>
    You can bet that you’ll all spend  a night in the hole<br>
     He says that he loves us  there’s no need to fear him<br>
    He’d prefer we reserve all  our fear for his God<br>
    But I fear whoever  does evil so easily<br>
    And thinks that he’s only  doing a job<br>
                 Chorus<br>
     The police have shown up  in outrageous numbers<br>
    Armed in their helmets  with their nightsticks and shields<br>
    The protesters marching  are righteously singing<br>
    “we haven’t come this far  to turn back or yield”<br>
    They bring out a firehose  and turn it upon us<br>
    Transforming the marchers  into some kind of mob<br>
    Who is it you officers  swore to defend and protect?<br>
    When you put on your uniform  and made this your job?<br>
                chorus<br>
     The army recruiters  are down on the corner<br>
    They’re telling young kids bout  the splendors of war<br>
    They’re showing their medals  and telling their stories<br>
    I’d just like to ask them  what they’re fighting for<br>
     Some fight cause they have to  cause they’re under fire<br>
    Cause they’re being bullied  and they don’t get a say<br>
    But some think it’s their duty  some think it’s the right thing<br>
    To blindly take orders  and collect your pay (the American Way) <br>
                Chorus<br>
     The judge in his tower  is looking down meanly<br>
    He’s raising his gavel  and drawing his breath<br>
    He announces the sentence  he does it routinely<br>
    “You’ve been proven guilty  and your penalty’s death”<br>
     He won’t say he’s sorry  he hasn’t got pity<br>
    “Whatever you done, now, that’s between you and God,”<br>
    When he arrives home, the judge will sleep soundly<br>
    Assuring himself he’s just doing his job<br>
                 chorus      </p>

    <p>In 1492 Chris Columbus and his crew<br>
    Discovered folks a living in some islands to the west<br>
    He promised to be kind, but he went and changed his mind<br>
    Made most of them his slaves and put the rest of em to death          <br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                Perhaps the terms of his agreement wasn’t heard, heard, heard<br>
                But it’s a getting late—how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 1838 Andrew Jackson did create<br>
    A paper sayin that the natives would receive their promised land<br>
    Made a reservation zone, drove em into Oklahome<br>
    Leaving Cherokee and chocktaw blood in the Mississippi sand<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the lyin simply couldn’t have endured, -dured, -dured<br>
                But it’s a getting late—how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words? <br>
     In 1864—trine to end the civil war<br>
    Mr. Lincoln signed a paper sayin all slaves would be free<br>
    Soon as he let em go—in came the Old Jim Crow<br>
    And the rest, I’m sure you know, is US history<br>
                If I didn’t know any better, I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise has only been deferred –ferred –ferred<br>
                But it’s a getting late—how long you wanna wait<br>
                Fore you admit that a promise is just words, words, words<br>
     In August ’45—trine to keep his own alive<br>
    Harry Truman told the Japanese, “this fighting’s gotta stop,”<br>
    Any more lives bein spent, he said he would try to prevent—<br>
    Then he loaded up his atom bombs, said “Fellas, let em drop—”<br>
                If I didn’t know—any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise was always bein urged, urged, urged<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait<br>
                Fore you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 1954, in a case called Brown v. Board<br>
    The Supreme Court said that public schools must integrate their kids <br>
    They took their time, of course, with getting it enforced<br>
    And fore anything could happen, it was like nothing ever did <br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the ruling sounded too good to’ve occurred, -curred, -curred<br>
                But it’s getting late, how long you gonna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?        <br>
     In 1964, hungry for another war,<br>
    Lyndon Johnson said a US ship had been hit by Viet Cong<br>
    And though it was a lie, he still sent troops to die<br>
    In the name of keeping communism out of Vietnam<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That what ain’t democratic ain’t preferred, -ferred, -ferred <br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait <br>
                For you admit that democracy’s a word, word, word<br>
     In 1982 Ronald Regan, tride and true,<br>
    Said he’d increased public safety and on crime he waged a war<br>
    For him, tho, being safe—had to do with class and race—<br>
    Most of the folks he rounded up were young and black and poor <br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise aimed to keep us all secured, -cured, -cured<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you gonna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 1992 the war on crime and drugs just grew<br>
    Mr. Clinton said he had a plan and it would be unfurled<br>
    He built prisons left and right, filled em practically overnight<br>
    Now the US has more prisoners than any nation in the world<br>
                If I didn’t know—any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the lockdown was a bad dream that emerged, merged, merged<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 2001, weapons of mass destruction<br>
    Was the reason Mr. Bush supplied to re-invade Iraq<br>
    The nukes were never found, but the country was torn down<br>
    and US oil prices were a little lower after that<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise didn’t sound quite so absurd, -surd, -surd<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait <br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     Now this song could go on, and on and on and on<br>
    The lies my leaders told me are too numerous to name<br>
    But I’m a getting tired, my patience is expired<br>
    As we move into the future, the song will be the same<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose <br>
                That a government, in all things, should be just, just, just<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit if it’ll be just it’ll have to be up to us?     </p>

    <p>Yes, there’s a storm a comin, it’s on the Times front page<br>
    With a black and white photo of some kind of giant tidal wave<br>
    On account of how everybody’s gone ahead and behaved<br>
    The street preacher’s wound-up, screaming none will be saved<br>
     “By the pharaoh’s order,” cries the fouled referee,<br>
    “There’s a new law round here says that the curfew will be<br>
    From ten in the morning til quarter past three<br>
    Anybody outside after that’s gonna haveta answer to me!”<br>
     you better get your name cleared, Bluebeard, fore they make you walk the plank<br>
    Better call off your watchdogs, General, fore they all pull rank <br>
    You better get your children, Mama, bow your head and give thanks <br>
    You better grow your hair long, Samson—you gonna need your strength<br>
      You’re tween a rock and a hardplace they’re still trying to construct<br>
    When the bombs fall, Know-It-All, you better have the good sense to duck<br>
    At the rodeo, John Doe, keep your seat on that truck<br>
    and bring along your timepiece, Maurice, you gonna need some luck<br>
     well everyone’s getting bored, but I’ve already had me a few<br>
    Better take a knee, Bruce Lee, if you need something to do <br>
    It’s a sure-thing, Sherlock, but you ain’t got a clue<br>
    Aw, get out of here, Shakespeare—nobody asked you <br>
                 Chorus<br>
     Jumpin Jupiter, Lucifer, what’s become of your pride?<br>
    Didn’t anybody tell you that the sooth-sayer lied? <br>
    For a sheckel, Dr. Jeckyll, we can go for a ride<br>
    I’ll show you someplace remote where you can lay low and hide<br>
     Now I’m no Houdini and I’m no Jesse James <br>
    But you’re gonna need brass keys, Ulysses, to get out of them chains<br>
    You better smell the roses, Moses, and talk some sense to these brains<br>
    Otherwise all of your guys is gonna wind up changing their trains<br>
                 Chorus<br>
     Grow your hair long, Samson—til it’s down to your knees<br>
                Grow your hair long, Samson—til it’s long as you please<br>
                Grow your hair long, Samson—til it’s at full-length<br>
                Grow your hair long, Samson—you gonna need your strength<br>
     The doctor’s in the dentist’s chair, his tooth’s getting pulled—<br>
    Your wienereimer, Oppenheimer, has come down with a cold<br>
    I tried calling the police, the operator put me on hold<br>
    I can see your cards, Beauregard, if I were you I would fold<br>
     The captain’s gone AWOL on some binocular tour<br>
    With a lady in sales he met at the marine supply store<br>
    When the saloonkeeper’s drunk he’ll give everyone a free pour<br>
    But you better get it while you can fore he ain’t drunk anymore<br>
                 Chorus<br>
     Fare thee well, Rafael, I guess you done pretty good<br>
    They did their best to imitate you, but none of them could<br>
    Ahab took a stab and saw what was under the hood<br>
    Then he tried to say it in English—no one understood<br>
     Goldilocks needs help, she’s got her hand caught in the hive<br>
    You better be heartfelt, Mrs. Roosevelt, when you write those boys’ wives<br>
    You gonna need an editor, Senator, to keep talking that jive<br>
    It’s neither heroes nor villians, it’s just the lucky survive<br>

    <p>Who, mama, who is that great giant yonder<br>
    Who stands twenty times taller than any tree?<br>
    My child, my child, yonder’s America<br>
    They call her the Statue of Liberty<br>
     What, mama, what is that big giant tower<br>
    That starts on the ground and disappears in the air?<br>
    My child, my child, that’s just a skyscraper <br>
    You’ll probably be seeing them round here everywhere<br>
     What, mama, what is that long silver bullet<br>
    That’s snaking around on that bridge up above<br>
    My child, my child, that’s only the subway<br>
    We’ll be riding on that train soon enough<br>
     Where, mama, where did you say we were going?<br>
    How long must we wait in this subway station?<br>
    My child, my child, we’re heading to Manhattan<br>
    To the US Office of Immigration <br>
     Who, mama, who is that ragged man sleeping<br>
    There on the curb, who’s just skin and bone?<br>
    My child, my child, it’s only a hobo<br>
    Don’t point your finger, just leave him alone<br>
     Who, mama, who is that finely dressed person<br>
    Who’s fat as a king, and only short of a crown<br>
    My child, my child, that’s a rich, wealthy banker<br>
    Get out of his way or he’ll mow you right down<br>
     Why, mama, why are some people so hungry<br>
    Meanwhile there’s others that look rich in their clothes?<br>
    My child, my child, I don’t know the reason<br>
    I don’t have an answer, God only knows<br>
     Who, mama, who is that man with the night-stick<br>
    And why is that other man being beaten by him?<br>
    My child, my child, that’s only the police<br>
    In America they arrest you for having dark skin <br>
     Where, mama, where, mama—where will they take him?<br>
    will they take him to a doctor to treat his wounds and his sores?<br>
    My child, my child, they’re taking him to prison<br>
    In America that’s what they do with their poor<br>
     Ain’t mama, ain’t, mama—ain’t this a free country?<br>
    Aren’t people here given value and worth?<br>
    My child, my child—it’s only for some folks— <br>
    There’s more prisoners here than anyplace on the earth<br>
     Why, mama, why, mama—why did we come here?<br>
    What in the world did we leave our home for?<br>
    My child, my child—it just wasn’t safe there<br>
    Our country’s is facing genocide and war<br>
     Here mama, here mama, here is the building<br>
    I will wait for you here, steadfast and strong<br>
    My child, my child, I’ll just be a minute<br>
    I will go and come back—it shouldn’t take long<br>
     Why mama, why, mama—why are you crying?<br>
    Where did they tell you that we may reside?<br>
    My child, my child, they gave me no answer<br>
    But that our request to live here has been denied<br>
     Why, mama, why can’t we live in America?<br>
    Are there too many people?  Is there not enough land?<br>
    My child, my child, it’s the people in charge here<br>
    They hate and they fear what they don’t understand<br>
     When, mama, when will we be accepted?<br>
    When will this hatred be brought to a close?<br>
    My child, my child—I don’t have an answer<br>
    I don’t have an answer, God only knows    </p>

    <p>You crossed a black cat’s path when you encountered me<br>
    Somebody should have said  this here was a carnival<br>
    The only way out again’s  back through the livingroom<br>
    Which you were just driven from  on account of your destiny<br>
    You, with your vacant heart  throwing your weight around<br>
    Just like you owned the joint  or like you knew someone<br>
    Making your crass remarks  into their fold-out smiles<br>
    As all of their watches chimed  and somewhere a sailor drowned<br>
     Tears like a jet-streamed sky  raking your made-up face<br>
    I caught a glimpse of you  inside the hallway meer<br>
    You looked like a vagabond  you looked like a stolen wife<br>
    Or what is the word for it?  you looked simply out of place<br>
     And as the hostess rose  shouting her lover’s name<br>
    Crying for ornaments  and for a tablecloth<br>
    I saw how you fell apart  then gathered up yourself<br>
    You puttem all to shame, you puttem all to shame<br>
                II<br>
    Just as the matador  flung off his captain’s cape<br>
    in preparation for  some kind of ritual<br>
    the astronaut cleared his throat  as if he would make a toast<br>
    then he restrained himself  with a whole roll of plumber’s tape<br>
     “I don’t care what the bible says,”  shouted the bathroom stall<br>
    addressing the minister  distributing sacraments<br>
    Out of a purse he stole  out of the parsonage<br>
    Pardoning pilferage  at no extra charge at all<br>
     Back at the ranch meanwhile  nobody’d moved a bone<br>
    The sheriff was flinging cards  into a hangman’s noose<br>
    The deputy watched a fly  buzzin around the room<br>
    Drew back the velvet drapes  looked out at a parking cone<br>
     A fat lady stood and belched  saluted the flag and sang:<br>
    Somewhere a child is born  somewhere a child dies<br>
    Nobody looks at you  they don’t think you’re beautiful<br>
    But you puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
                 You puttem all to shame, just like a needle plunging into a vein <br>
                That carries the antidote that’s full of the cure from the heart to the brain<br>
                You puttem all to shame—<br>
                III<br>
    Lord Alfred makes his rounds  handing out red balloons<br>
    Asking for tickets, please  saying Please Watch Your Step <br>
    Producing a handkerchief  dripping with turpentine<br>
    Peddling silverware  and stopping to smell the fumes<br>
     The emperor’s crown’s been caught  over the mantelpiece<br>
    A bystander claimed it was  made out of mistletoe<br>
    Lonely men gathered round  waiting for girls to come<br>
    The pianist blew trombone  his requiem masterpiece <br>
     The sofa is filling up  like it was a safety boat<br>
    With politician’s wives  and the offspring of janitors<br>
    There was a pack of dogs  I think they were Sherlock Holmes’<br>
    Charging the drawbridge doors  molesting an overcoat<br>
     And you in your pleated skirt  looking so torn apart<br>
    How did your hair get wet?  it’s not even raining out<br>
    I could have kissed you then  you would have hated me<br>
    You puttem all to shame, you puttem all to shame<br>
     IV<br>
     Up at the podium  the weatherman prophesies<br>
    all bets are off this year  blaming technology<br>
    The postman has been delayed  due to the hurricane<br>
    Just then some legs walked in  in search of a centipede <br>
     the judge entered, wig-and-all  some people stood and cheered<br>
    others threw fruit at him  others forget-me-nots<br>
    his gavel was in his hand  his sword hanging by his side<br>
    his breath smelled of bubblegum  bacon grease in his beard<br>
     and people have asked before  what is it I see in you<br>
    I always respond to them  well isn’t it obvious?<br>
    You held a parasol  under a chandelier <br>
    You lit your cigarette  in the coals of a barbecue<br>
     It was your corkscrew gaze  meeting my tailspin frame<br>
    that was the moment when  I knew you were the one<br>
    they were the best of theirs  you were no match for them <br>
    you put em all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
                 you puttem all to shame, just like a lost child that nobody claims<br>
                whose manifest radiance is offered to everyone and then goes down the drain<br>
     V<br>
     serpentine pedagogues  brandishing chilled vermouth<br>
    using their intellects  as if they were hand-grenades<br>
    Sodom is burning down  there’s firetrucks everywhere<br>
    And Socrates’ dies tonight  for trying to corrupt the youth<br>
     head like a pile of rocks  face like a punching-bag<br>
    nobody thinks I’m cute  narcissus vainly wines  <br>
    he asks the river who  is fairest of them all?<br>
    the one with the stupid hat  that looks like a launching-pad<br>
     Mathematicians trade  stories with psychopaths<br>
    About what is possible  in the grand scheme of things<br>
    The psychopath wants to know  whether it’s feasible<br>
    The metaphysicians claim  it really just basic math<br>
     Eventually you’re convinced  Chess is a bachelor’s game<br>
    The neighbors are victims of  suburban piracy<br>
    Going from door to door  Showing their business-cards<br>
    You puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     VI<br>
     you move through the marketplace  like you was a stranger there<br>
    taking a hold of things  asking how much is this?<br>
    If a wheelbarrow full of cash  is the price of a loaf of bread<br>
    What will you pay to me  to relinquish my rockingchair?<br>
     Or cut to the figurines  dancing in silhouette<br>
    one dressed in corduroys  one in a diamond suit<br>
    the princess of India  in the arms of a scalawag<br>
    whose playing the fool tonight  trying to pirouette<br>
     Down in the lower depths  beneath the catacombs<br>
    Echoes of subway trains  hurtling overhead<br>
    The hands of a claustrophobe  touching the hands of God <br>
    Wound up in heavy chains  reaching for help and home<br>
     Robin Hood checks his gauge  flawlessly changes lanes<br>
    Everyone beeps at him  tells him where he can go<br>
    From his perspective though  these are just bumper cars<br>
    You puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     VII<br>
     I watched you donning masks  out in the alleyways<br>
    Practicing tones of voice  under a crescent moon<br>
    You were the mermaid queen  tossing a skipping stone<br>
    Into a sea of sand  a valley of microwaves <br>
     Someone was guiding me  they must’ve got lost, I guess<br>
    Out in the wilderness  look at that burning bush<br>
    I heard what sounded like  a wandering pack of wolves<br>
    pathetically fingernailed  clawing a dead-man’s chest<br>
     Next time I pass this way  better have your eyes peeled<br>
    Stuck in their sockets like  they was a pair of bulbs<br>
    I’ll be in desperate straits  I’ll be insane with grief <br>
    Dragging a tire-swing  out of a potter’s field <br>
     somebody threw himself  off the midnight Express<br>
    they said it was suicide  it was indisputable<br>
    nobody knew him though  he claimed to be everyone<br>
    you puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     VIII<br>
     the referee’s missing tooth  turned up in a boxingglove<br>
    that was inside the wedding-cake  they sent to the funeral<br>
    the one that read: Warmst Regards  From All of Us Back Home<br>
    depicting a concubine  dispensing a mother’s love<br>
     and as the warden waits  examining old brochures <br>
    that advertised Michigan  that spoke of an afterlife<br>
    the inmates are at their bars  releasing their mourning doves<br>
    that’re seen from the passing bus  offering city-tours <br>
     Mother Teresa writes  in an old-fashioned style<br>
    An overdue letter to  a boyfriend across the sea<br>
    Enclosing a photograph  in which she is posing nude<br>
    Saying, Next time you come  why don’t you stay awhile?<br>
     And here’s Satan’s latest prize  the one with the swollen brain<br>
    Riding the chariot  into the stadium’s mouth<br>
    What are you waiting for?  who are you hiding from?<br>
    you puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     IX<br>
     the inferno calmly climbs  up on a bail of hay<br>
    Inviting martyrdom  down from its pedestal<br>
    the difference tween them and you’s  same as the difference tween<br>
    a woman that’s made of flesh  and one that’s just made of clay<br>
     You came down the spiral stair  the way I’ve seen waterfall<br>
    Or like a shooting star  or like sinking hope<br>
    you had your hat on square  all perpendicular<br>
    you spoke in pentameter  like some kind of know it all<br>
    suddenly here we are  inside the final ring<br>
    Here at the empty room  here at the final hour<br>
    Traitors are telling lies  trying to avoid the blame<br>
    Elderly couples sit  fondly remembering<br>
     I wrote, “Dear Beatrice,”  like I had forgot your name<br>
    Composing my epitaph  using a ball-point pen<br>
    and for the hundredth time  inside a half-an-hour<br>
    you puttem all to shame   you puttem all to shame    </p>

    <h2>Absalom - Part 1</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>King David and his concubines begat between them several sons<br>
    And of the lot, none there were more handsome than the one they called—<br>
    Absalom was brother to a younger sister named Tamar<br>
    In all the kingdom that was known, none there were more fair than she<br>
    Tamar was prized by many men who meant to win her as a bride<br>
    Not exempting the king’s firstborn, Amnon was what he was called.<br>
    By feigning he was ill one day, Amnon lured Tamar to him<br>
    And when she came to nurse his cold, he seized her strongly by the arm<br>
    “Why have you taken hold of me? Wherefore this sudden strength of yours?<br>
    Do you intend that I should lie with you? What ever do you take me for?”<br>
    And what Tamar refused to yield, Amnon cruelly took by force<br>
    And hoping he was someplace near, Tamar called out her brother’s name:<br>
                A——————Absalom!—where, O where, can you be? <br>
                A——————Absalom!—would that you were here to rescue me </p>
 
    <p>When Absalom received the news that Amnon had his sister raped<br>
    He was angry but he did not act, he said, “Let us see what the king will do.”<br>
    When David did receive the news, bitter and angry did he turn<br>
    But no penalty would he dole, for Amnon was his firstborn son.<br>
    So Absalom conceived a plan to take revenge upon Amnon<br>
    And when two years had run their course, he held a banquet at his house.<br>
    And all the while he hid his hate he felt for Amnon and his Sin<br>
    Meanwhile caring for Tamar who resolved to show her face no more.<br>
    When Amnon was drunk with wine, Absalom shouted, “The time has come!”<br>
    And all his servants rose at once and Amnon with their swords did slay.<br>
    And as he fell beneath their blades, outnumbered and without defense<br>
    And as his spirit left his flesh, these words was Amnon heard to say:<br>
                Absalom!—with my last breath, your life I’ll curse <br>
                Absalom!—this death is bad; may yours be worse     </p>

    <p>God made the world in six short days<br>
    On the seventh he took a rest<br>
    On the eighth he woke up in a mood<br>
    Said, “I wonder what I’ll do next—”<br>
    He watched men work together<br>
    To build a tower that went up a mile<br>
    When it seemed there’d be no stopping them<br>
    God grinned and said, “I know, I’ll—</p>
 
    <p>Burn it down—down—down—down<br>

    Humble Abraham stepped in<br>
    “If there’s one worthwhile man living there<br>

    That the search would prove a futile one<br>
    It couldn’t be long denied—<br>
    And when the time had come and gone<br>
    Abe surrendered and replied:<br>

    <p>Samson was the strongest man<br>
    That ever walked the earth<br>
    He loved Delilah even though<br>
    She was a Philistine by birth<br>
    She betrayed him for her people’s sake<br>
    And cut off all his hair<br>
    It grew back in his captivity<br>
    And then he burst right out of there, to<br>

    <p>Old John Brown was tried and hanged<br>
    By now his story you’ve probly heard:<br>
    How on the scaffold he did stand<br>
    To speak his final words:<br>
    “When law and conscience don’t agree<br>
    That’s when you’ve gotta stand and fight<br>
    I don’t regret a single thing I done—<br>

    <p>I could see through the rearview<br>
    I was no longer near you<br>
    I could no longer hear you <br>
    no matter how hard I tried</p>
 
    <p>you seemed to be distant<br>
    here and gone in an instant<br>
    just to stay for a short stint<br>
    just along for the ride</p>
 
    <p>you asked for directions<br>
    and you took up collections<br>
    didn’t need no protectin<br>
    your plans were all drawn</p>
 
    <p>I could tell you were tired<br>
    Not exactly inspired<br>
    Though you know I admired<br>
    How long you held on</p>

    <h2>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Once pon a time in a faraway place there lived two young boys with their father<br>
    One was in charge of keeping the sheep, in charge of everything else was his brother<br>
    The shepherd was told to keep his eyes peeled, to look out for wolves with their cunning<br>
    Was told if he saw anything that looked strange, to yell, and the villiage’d come running<br>
    For a while he did just like he was told, but he found the watch rather boring<br>
    So one quiet night he raised the alarm while the entire villiage was snoring:</p>
 
    <p>Wolf! There’s a wolf! O, somebody help!<br>
                Somebody please, I ain’t lyin<br>
                Get up from your beds, you been sleepin too long<br>
                Cant anyone hear me cryin?</p>
 
    <p>So up from their beds the villiagers arose, hoping to prevent some disaster<br>
    But when they got to the boy with their pitchforks and blades, they found he was dyin of                                                                                                                                    laughter<br>
    “You idiot boy,” his father exclaimed, “Didn’t I raise you to know better?”<br>
    Than to behave just like a fool? Why can’t you be more like your brother?”<br>
    “I’m sorry,” he said, “won’t happen again,” and on he went pologizing<br>
    But the very next night when the town was asleep, a cry from the fields it came rising</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>So up from their beds the villagers arose, hoping to prevent some disaster<br>
    And when they got to the boy with their pitchforks and blades, they found him there dyin                                                                                                                                    of laughter<br>
    “Fooled us again, shame on us,” they said, “We really ought to have known better,”<br>
    And they all went away shaking their heads, wishing the boy was more like his brother<br>
    The very next night, a wolf, it appeared; the boy saw it but he raised no holler<br>
    He managed to chase it away from his flock into the house of his brother</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>But no one got up tho the screams they all heard, thought, “it’s only that boy who’s been<br>
                                                                                                                                        lyin,”
    <p>and everyone slept with wax in their ears while the innocent one went on dyin<br>
    next morning the father asked his son, “Son, tell me, where is your brother?”<br>
    the boy replied, “How am I sposed to know? Am I my brother’s keeper?”    </p>

    <p>Death was out riding his horse in the desert<br>
    When he happened upon two traveling men<br>
    One of them saw his face in the distance<br>
    And took off back the way they had come</p>
 
    <p>When Death made his way within range of the other<br>
    He tipped his hat and said, “it’s alright—<br>
    He said, “I’m only surprised to find him all the way out here<br>
    We’ve an appointment in town tonight,” </p>
 
    <p>Now I used to know where it was I was going<br>
    My life had purpose, direction and aim—<br>
    But somewhere I lost my defense against knowing<br>
    That in the end you wind up losing the game </p>
 
    <p>You can never escape it, outrun it, outsmart it<br>
    It’s like a storm that’s hanging over the sea—<br>
    O but cant I be devoured without being required<br>
    to worship what’s swallowing me?</p>
 
    <p>maybe you’re a little more discerning<br>
                and you already know what I’m still learning<br>
                and you’ve extinguished what I’ve been burning</p>
                            a long, long time, to know
 
    <p>but given the option between staying and moving<br>
                saying and doing<br>
                begging and choosing—<br>
                I’ll do whichever brings me quickest to ruin—I’m only human, you know </p>
 
    <p>I am the prodigal son’s younger brother<br>
    Who stayed home and tended the flock<br>
    Who, despite having dreams of his own to accomplish, stayed<br>
    Only to wind up the laughingstock;</p>
 
    <p>I am not perfect—no one is perfect<br>
    But perfection plagues the rational soul<br>
    That is always trying to realize that trying<br>
    To realize isn’t even the goal</p>
 
    <p>Prick my finger—I will show you my bloodline<br>
    Tickle me, and I may smile<br>
    Poison me and I’ll accuse you of something<br>
    And die, reluctantly, after a while</p>
 
    <p>I feel the want of generations before me<br>
    I pre-curse all the sorrow to come<br>
    For all of our time here, we have done nothing—<br>
    So long as work is yet to be done</p>
 
    <p>But maybe you’re a hair more saintly<br>
                Or maybe you just don’t hear so faintly<br>
                But we’re all sorta rotten—ain’t we?—</p>
                            And we reap the seeds that we sew—
 
    <p>Given the option between hurting and healing<br>
                Standing and kneeling<br>
                Buying and stealing<br>
                I’ll do whichever keeps me under the ceiling—I’m only human, you know </p>
 
    <p>Jesus Christ was sent here to save us<br>
    With a message and a couple of tricks<br>
    wherever he went he encountered a creature<br>
    that struck him as too broken to fix</p>
 
    <p>he once asked to please be relieved of his mission<br>
    he said, “nobody here understands,<br>
    Everyone thinks I’m chosen and special<br>
    I keep telling them, I’m only a man—”</p>
 
    <p>He died on a Friday, lay dead on a Saturday<br>
    On Sunday morning he rose<br>
    When they rolled the stone away from his coffin<br>
    all they found were what remained of his clothes</p>
 
    <p>two fellas out on their way to Emmaus<br>
    saw him and said there’s more to retrieve,<br>
    jesus said, “even if you manage to get their attention<br>
    you’ll have to die just to make them believe,”</p>
 
    <p>but maybe you’ll be more successful<br>
                when your angel pulls you in to wrestle<br>
                and you won’t have to sink the vessel—just to make still waters flow</p>
 
    <p>but given the option between staying and leaving<br>
                giving and recieving<br>
                nothing and grieving <br>
                I’ll take whichever staunches the bleeding—I’m only human, you know</p>
 
    <p>And so here we are on the eve of adventure<br>
    The brink of destruction, the moment of goodbye<br>
    Nothing is happening, but a faucet is leaking<br>
    And darkness is filling the sky</p>
 
    <p>And you want to know if tomorrow I’ll be here<br>
    Right where you leave me, here in the door like this<br>
    And I want to know if this isn’t your clever way<br>
    Of telling me my chance has been missed</p>
 
    <p>So go to your bretheren, return to your battlefield<br>
    Take whatever strength you got left<br>
    Your cards are all showing now, you’ve been holding them clumsily<br>
    Close to the wound at your chest</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps you’ll think less of me, but perhaps that’s reality<br>
    And you ought not to go building up myths<br>
    Sometimes the tools that you use to escape yourself<br>
    Become the chains you imprison it with</p>
 
    <p>But maybe I’m just too ill-tempered<br>
                Sophomoric and self-centered<br>
                To recognize that the race I’ve entered</p>
                            Has been traveling much too slow
 
    <p>But given the option between flying and falling<br>
                Lying and sprawling—crying and bawling<br>
                I’ll do whichever proves itself as my calling—I’m only human, you know    </p>

    <p>I could be outcast, outnumbered and outlawed<br>

    If I was sore and couldn’t bare your touch<br>
    If for whatever reason it just got to be too much<br>
    It got to be more than I could endure</p>
 
    <p>If I lost that which I could not retrieve<br>
    And only felt what I couldn’t perceive<br>
    If I knew you weren’t –I’d still believe<br>
    Anyway, that you were</p>

    <h2>The Ballad of Judas Iscariot</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 7</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>My name it is an epitaph, my tale it is too sad to tell<br>
    For I have done the hangman’s math, when I leave this earth, I’m bound for hell.<br>
    I started out a fisherman, I spent my youth beside the sea<br>
    Until one day a shepherd came, said, “Put down thy nets and come with me.”<br>
    He folded me into his flock and taught me how to serve the poor<br>
    My faith in him was like a rock, until it wasn’t anymore.<br>
    For many years I followed him, one lost sheep wandring with the rest<br>
    But alone to me he’d often said I was the one he loved the best.<br>
    And as we roamed the country fair, and preached the good news from on high<br>
    The authorities, they did declare, “He is gaining strength, and so he must die!”<br>
    And late one night I dreamed a dream, an angel came and spoke to me<br>
    He said I was the dark machine that was mentioned in the prophesy.<br>
    He told me how to play my part, said, “Altho you love him to the rind,<br>
    You must betray him in your heart, so that he can save mankind.”<br>
    And when I wakened from my spell, my faint resolve began to grow<br>
    But whether it was from God or Hell—that is something I will never know.<br>
    I sought the high-priest to inquire, “What will you give for Jesus Christ?”<br>
    He gave the sum and went no higher, “Thirty silver pieces for his life.”<br>
    At supper on the final night, he spoke and said he already knew<br>
    He’d been betrayed and he’d lose the fight, he said, “I know that it was one of you.”<br>
    Around that room, denials poured as all our faces turned to red<br>
    “It wasn’t me, I swear, my Lord,” and Jesus: “Yeah, so you have said.”<br>
    That night I brought the sentries round, and as if to add insult to my sin,<br>
    When I kissed him on the ground, they paid me right in front of him.<br>
    He went before the judge and court, was mocked and sentenced then to die,<br>
    They hung him up upon the cross where he was flogged and crucified.<br>
    And worst of all that did transpire, worse than any guilt I own<br>
    Worse than hell’s eternal fire, were his last words to me alone:<br>
    As he was tortured, stabbed and maimed, as blood from his fresh wounds did spew<br>
    He looked at me, and said, “Be not ashamed—for already I have forgiven you.”<br>
    And saying that, he hung his head, as if to pray or give a nod<br>
    And when someone cried: “Enough—he’s dead,” they knew he was the Son of God.<br>
    No trial am I made to stand, no jury aims to see me hung<br>
    But I don’t think people understand just what it is that I have done.<br>
    I didn’t do it out of hate, out of malice, greed or jealousy—<br>
    I did it cause it was his fate, and because it was my destiny.<br>
    My name, it is Iscariot, I betrayed the Savior, Jesus Christ<br>
    My conscience cannot carry it: Thirty Silver Pieces for my life.     </p>

    <p>It’s seven degrees, I got no place to go<br>
    This time tomorrow, it’ll be ten below<br>
    Sun’s going down, it’s starting to snow<br>
    Lord have mercy on me<br>
    Lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>I’ve made my mistakes and I’ve got my regrets<br>
    Dug my own grave as I was placing those my bets<br>
    And now I ain’t got the money for to pay off my debts<br>
    Lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>My friends want me placed under arrest<br>
    My family agrees, and thinks it’d be for the best<br>
    To whom can I turn, now?  There’s nobody left—<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>Have mercy on me—tho I now am trembling<br>
                And did not do my daily share<br>
    Have mercy on me—and in thy remembering<br>
                Recall how frequent was my prayer</p>
 
    <p>others came to me, helpless, I kicked them to the curb<br>
    I took offense at their entitlement, gall and their nerve<br>
    I know this, now, is justice, it’s what I deserve, but<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>I have fled every place that I might’ve stayed<br>
    Conceded to fold right when I should have played<br>
    Is this here not the fate of which I’ve been so afraid?<br>
    Lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>It’s one thing I’ll mention of which I’m ashamed<br>
    I can’t seem to shoulder my own share of the blame<br>
    Stead of pitying myself, why can’t I just change?<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>Have mercy on me—tho the cost were too high<br>
                And the debt one more I could not repay      <br>
                Have mercy on me—so that rather than die<br>
                I can turn the favor someone else’s way</p>
 
    <p>Wherever there’s injustice, there’s histry to blame<br>
    I profit from the system I been fighting to change<br>
    But how can I be free when my brother’s in chains?<br>
    Lord Have Mercy on me!</p>
 
    <p>I feel like the ending is about to begin;<br>
    Ceiling’s coming down and the wall’s closing in<br>
    The wind’s picking up; the light’s getting dim<br>
    lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>The future’s been told in decipherable font<br>
    the past is a vessel the dead failed to haunt<br>
    teach me know what it’s important to want—<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks<br>
    Opinions are too hard to turn<br>
    But I say try it and see what sticks—<br>
    It ain’t never too late to learn</p>
 
    <p>I used to want to play the guitar<br>
    I thought I couldn’t cause I didn’t know how<br>
    Then I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and—<br>
    I think I’m getting the hang of hit now</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Our government’s got the strange idea<br>
    That private healthcare we all can afford<br>
    I guess the lawmakers have never either never been sick—<br>
    Or else they’ve never been poor</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Our government’s got the funny idea<br>
    that they’ve met all the public school needs<br>
    with teachers making less than a decent wage<br>
    there’s plenty left for the war overseas</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>There’s folks in this land who are full up of hate<br>
    Seems anger is all that they’ve got<br>
    They spread their harmful and hateful ideas<br>
    Exactly the way they were taught</p>
 
    <p>Don’t know about you but I’m starting to think<br>
    Maybe everybody’s to blame<br>
    Instead of trying to be right all the time<br>
    Why don’t we try being nice for a change?</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Some people think it’s too early to say<br>
    Some people think it’s already too late<br>
    Some say it’d be easier to move the sea with a spoon<br>
    Than to change the mind of the State</p>
 
    <p>Politicians got mouths, some got ears<br>
    Long as you got the money to burn<br>
    That’s the only time you’ll hear one of them say<br>
    “It ain’t never too late to learn”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Jesus arrived at the banker’s hall<br>
    Their tables he did overturn<br>
    He said, “I guess none of y’all’ve caught on yet—<br>
    But it ain’t never too late to learn”    </p>

    <h2>Absalom - Part 2</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>When Amnon’s life was smothered out, Absalom to his horse did take<br>
    For he knew that when his deed was known, he’d be the enemy of the state<br>
    And so began his long career as a fugitive and a refugee<br>
    Wherein he learned a thing or two about how common people lived.<br>
    And as he roamed from town to town and shared the campfires of the poor<br>
    He more than once revealed his tale and made his royal bloodlines known.<br>
    In time he gained some confidence, and did a reputation earn<br>
    For seeming just as fit to rule as, if not moreso than the king.<br>
    And into his mind there came a thought, which he did often speak aloud<br>
    “I wish my father wasn’t king—would that it had been me instead!” <br>
    When David did receive the news, bitter and angry did he turn<br>
    But no penalty would he dole, for Absalom was yet his son.<br>
    So David stood before his throng and asked the crowds that he could see<br>
    “Who among you would challenge me?”—the reply returned resoundingly: <br>
                Absalom!—what else is there now to discuss? <br>
                Absalom!—he has won the hearts of all of us! </p>
 
    <p>And so it came that Absalom conspired to overtake the throne<br>
    He raised an army of good men, it numbered many thousand strong.<br>
    When David did receive the news, a sadness overwhelmed his heart—<br>
    For though he’d been to war before, he’d not yet fought a son he loved.<br>
    So when the day of battle came, the King gave the orders to his men:<br>
    “though treacherous, my son is mine—if captured, please do spare his life.” <br>
    And as his men prepared to ride, King David said, “I will go, too.”<br>
    But Joab, David’s right-hand-man, replied, “No such thing shall you do.”<br>
    And forth both armies rode that day, their conflicts to resolve with war<br>
    and both sides suffered massive loss—twenty thousand died in all.<br>
    And Absalom among them died, his life concluding in this way:<br>
    As he was riding through the woods, he was clotheslined by an oak-tree branch<br>
    And tween the earth and sky he hung, for some while struggling to get loose<br>
    When upon his dangling form, rode Joab, David’s right-hand-man.  <br>
    And as the men of David’s force recalled to him the oath they made<br>
    Joab recounted all the slain, and said “—with this man’s life a debt is paid!”<br>
    And saying so he took three spears and stabbed them through the young man’s chest<br>
    and in this way was slain the son their beloved king had loved the best.<br>
    Then Joab sent two messengers back home to tell the tale world-wide<br>
    The first, that they had won the war, the second, that Absalom had died.<br>
    And all the people cheered with joy to know there had been victory<br>
    But David simply hung his head and wept bitter tears of misery<br>
    “What’s the cheering of ten thousand strong? What’s all the joy of battles won?<br>
    Compared to this deep grief I feel to be deprived of my beloved son?<br>
                Absalom!—my son, my son!  My son is dead! <br>
                Absalom!—would it had been me instead!”    </p>

    <p>Your eyes look heavy, your shirts stained with tears<br>
    You look like you aint had a good night’s rest in years<br>
    The evening is young yet, but the morning, she nears<br>
    All that lies in darkness soon will be made clear— <br>
                you can lose the burden, add your complaints to the pile<br>
                Why don’t you take your coat off and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>You look like you just seen the worst part of a brawl<br>
    I’d hate to see the other guy, if he even made it out at all<br>
    Youre on your last legs, with your back gainst the wall<br>
    If you try to move you know you’re just gonna fall<br>
                But seeing you try, man, you know it just makes me smile<br>
                Why don’t you take off your coat—and stay awhile? </p>
 
    <p>I got friends in low places, I got enemies close-by<br>
    I could tell you some stories that’d make you laugh til you cry<br>
    You can’t win em all, but you know you can try<br>
    But I ain’t sellin nothing that you don’t wanna buy <br>
                I ain’t gonna pressure you out of your own denial<br>
                Why don’t you take your coat off and stay awhile</p>
 
    <p>Can I fix for you a cup of something warm<br>
    While you dry off, take shelter from the storm?<br>
    The sails right off of their riggings have torn<br>
    Anything that needs doing’ll have to wait til the morn<br>
                your troubles out there are lined up in single file<br>
                why don’t you—take off your coat, and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>Wipe your muddy boots off, hang up your dusty hat<br>
    You’re makin me nervous pacing the floor like that<br>
    the bus is busted, the wheels have gone flat<br>
    there engine’s been burned up, along with the map <br>
                even if we were able, I wouldn’t drive one more mile<br>
                why don’t you—take your coat off, stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>you can make yourself at home, here, do just as you please<br>
    it’ll be morning fore the jailer gets back with the keys<br>
    the guards have gone home, soldiers stand at ease <br>
    You can do whatever you like—anything except leave<br>
                Ain’t nobody in here gonna put you on trail<br>
                Why don’t you—take off your coat and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>You don’t need to get angry, we’re all in the same boat<br>
    It’s not like anyone put our fates to a vote<br>
    It’s a dog-eat-dog world, and that’s all that she wrote<br>
    If it don’t make a good story, it’ll make a fine anecdote<br>
                I’ll even tell it to you, long as you don’t touch that dial<br>
                Why don’t you—take your coat off, and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>I also have struggled, I ain’t no different from you<br>
    Had all of my money strung up in my shoe<br>
    Had everything stolen from me a time or two<br>
    Had to start over, and relearn all that I knew<br>
                Be not afraid of me, honey, be reconciled—<br>
                Why don’t you—take off your coat, and stay awhile?    </p>

    <p>Met a cloud passin overhead through the windowpane right beside my bed<br>
    “Hello down there, are you,” it said, “Alive?”<br>
    I said “How am I to tell, sometimes I look alright when I feel like hell<br>
    I guess I’m doin well—enough to get by”</p>
 
    <p>I met a tree out on highway nine, a lone handsome ponderosa pine<br>
    He said he wished he had legs like mine so he could run<br>
    I said I’ll give you these here boots if you teach me how to lay down roots<br>
    He said sometimes there’s substitutes, but this just aint one</p>
 
    <p>And isn’t it just my luck—soon as I get goin, the goin get’s tough<br>
                Lose my shoes and the road gets rough on me again<br>
                I bet it all and they call my bluff, they leave me fifty cents when I need a buck<br>
                And I’m just trine to get out of bein stuck right where I am</p>
                            I’m still standin in the same spot where I began
                            Cept I’m sunk now a little bit deeper in the sand
                            And I’m cryin out for help cause I need a hand
                            You know I’ll return the favor someday, if I can
 
    <p>I met a doctor who was ill, who said it was only a matter of time until<br>
    The disease would begin to kill him or itself<br>
    He asked me what my trouble was, I said I’m just waitin for my bell to buzz<br>
    And even if it never does, at least I got my health</p>
 
    <p>I met a lady in a turquoise hat, she asked me a few questions about this and that<br>
    And in 30 seconds flat she forgot my name<br>
    She told me her biography, along with most of the whole world’s history<br>
    And for what escaped her memory she felt ashamed</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I got a pen that just won’t write, got a pack of matches, not a one will light<br>
    I got a song for you tonight, but it won’t make you stay<br>
    I got a knife that just won’t cut, a refrigerator door that won’t stay shut<br>
    I got a lot of things here, but what good are they?</p>
 
    <p>I got one eye that just won’t blink, got a thirst I can’t quench with just one drink<br>
    I got a brain that just can’t think it’s troubles through<br>
    I got a parrot that won’t repeat, got a hunger in me that just don’t wanna eat<br>
    I got a heart that just won’t beat for no one else but you</p>

    <p>Moved to the city the other day,<br>
    Less to be there than to get away<br>
    I got a quarter of the space I had, and the rent it costs a pile<br>
    My roommates all work through the night<br>
    Come home at dawn put out the lights<br>
                 Sleep all day and all afternoon<br>
                Wake up again when they can see the moon<br>
                Their trash all through the apartment’s strewn<br>
                They say I’ll be like them pretty soon <br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city—for a while </p>
 
    <p>Time came when I should’ve wrote<br>
    I sent a postcard to my folks<br>
    Dear Ma, I’m so depressed I’ve forgotten how to smile<br>
    Nobody knows my name<br>
    And every day is about the same<br>
                The sun comes up and the sun goes down<br>
                People just trine to move around<br>
                Everybody wears a frown<br>
                You say hello, they look at the ground<br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city—for a while</p>
 
    <p>My coat’s dirty, tattered, torn<br>
    My pants is old and warped and worn<br>
    My boots is so full up of holes and get worse with every mile<br>
    Walkin round here and there<br>
    It’s hard to make it most anywhere<br>
                Trucks a honkin, trolley’s squeakin<br>
                Trains a rumbling, cars a beepin<br>
                At 3 am the neighbor’s screamin<br>
                Fore you know it, I’ll be leavin<br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city—for a while</p>
 
    <p>I was bred in the place I’m from<br>
    But here I feel just like a crumb<br>
    When you’re used to woods and mountains, the city’s what seems wild<br>
    Sometimes people start to yell<br>
    What at, though, you can’t always tell<br>
                Hey—what’re you lookin at?<br>
                Hey—how are you doin, cat?<br>
                What do you know? How bout that? <br>
                Look out you don’t step on that rat    <br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city for a while</p>
 
 
    <p>A good job has been hard to find<br>
    That’ll keep you out of the daily grind<br>
    Every morning its like herded sheep, all in single file<br>
    The workers come in from outside<br>
    In a car or bus or train they ride<br>
                The builders build the buildings tall<br>
                Back you right up against the wall<br>
                Make you feel that you’re pretty small<br>
    Til you got no room to yourself at all<br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city for a while</p>
 
    <p>Folks tell me in a while I’ll see<br>
    A change start to come over me<br>
    You’ll still think you’re miserable but you’ll just be in denial<br>
    You’ll get away for a week or two<br>
    Go to the shore, take in the view<br>
                Youll miss the sidewalks and the throng<br>
    They’ll sing to you like a siren-song<br>
    You’ll see you’ve loved it all along<br>
                You’ll start to feel like something’s wrong:<br>
    You’ll think you gotta get back to the city for a while    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The time now has come for facing the facts, our love has grown cold to the touch<br>
    We’re giving it everything that we have and our best still ain’t good enough<br>
    Perhaps I’m to blame for trying too hard to make this into something it wasn’t<br>
    For making the case that it matters to you when both of us know that it doesn’t<br>
    But who knows in spite of all that went wrong, it might still have turned out okay<br>
    If you hadn’t a snagged me and dragged me along every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>You don’t have to make like you’re really upset, you don’t have to tell me you’re sorry<br>
    You don’t gotta act like it’s the end of the world, it’s only the end of our story<br>
    I can’t really say that I’m glad it occurred, but I won’t say I’m sorry it’s over<br>
    The things about me that you still haven’t heard are probably best left undiscovered<br>
    But you never know somehow we might’ve pulled thru, might’ve even gotten married someday<br>
    If you hadn’t a lived like you’d nothing to lose, every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>I like to believe I can account for my part more than only part of the time<br>
    That what looks like a fault’s just a lapse in attention rather than a flaw in design<br>
    The vultures that swooped down to feed on my spleen were merely doing what they were made to<br>
    The leeches that drained me and sucked my bones clean shouldn’t have frightened or phased you<br>
    And as for the demons that hounded my heart, you know I could’ve kept em at bay<br>
    If you hadn’t a pushed me and pulled me apart, every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>You said you were tired of having this fight, the one that always ends in confusion<br>
                With one of us kissing the other goodnight and returning to the routine illusion<br>
                The picture in glass that hangs on your wall, the one in which everyone’s laughin<br>
                Seems to account for how I can recall events that never actually happened<br>
                But even with my head in a fog, I might’ve made it out of the gray<br>
                If you hadn’t a thrown a wrench in the cog every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>From now on I’ll do my best to be fair whenever telling people about us<br>
                I’ll say that our roads ran together awhile and then quite simply went on without us<br>
                You’ve taken your portion and dealt out your share of insults and harmful lines<br>
                if you’ve told me once I’m an old so-and-so, then you’ve told me a thousand times<br>
                And who knows, even in spite of the odds, we might’ve overcome the forces at play<br>
                If you hadn’t a toyed with and tempted the gods, every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>your promises frequently died in their birth or unraveled like thread on a spool<br>
                And your favors all cost me more than their worth, and your help was at best miniscule<br>
                Cause you never so little as tried to be kind, and you never so much as succeeded<br>
                in the object of snubbing and robbing me blind, a hint would’ve been all that I needed<br>
                But who knows, despite all the reasons to go, I might’ve found the courage to stay<br>
                If you hadn’t accused me of moving too slow every little step of the way </p>
 
    <p>I have been called many things in my time, but a traveler’s what I mainly am<br>
                With nothing to tell of where I am bound, nor to say of where it was I began<br>
                When I come to a fork in the road, I pause; sometimes it’s just a second or two<br>
                Long enough to suppose that I am the sum of everything that I’ve been through<br>
                But the light’s never still where I stand alone, and I can afford no further delay<br>
                And I dream that I’m always arriving at home with every little step of the way     </p>

    <h2>Something Blue</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>So you say you’ve finally found the one you been awaiting all your life<br>
    And you say that now he’s asked for you to come and be his wife<br>
    And by the way you’re smiling now, I don’t suppose you told him, “No,”<br>
    I don’t suppose you said where he could go— </p>
 
    <p>And every bride within your family’s had some tradition to stick to<br>
    With something old, something brand-new, something borrowed, something blue<br>
    To wear or carry down the aisle to satisfy the trend<br>
    And you say you’d like my advice, just as your friend</p>
 
    <p>For something old you got that wedding dress your great-grandmother sewed<br>
                For something new, you got that wedding ring of 14 karat gold<br>
                For something borrowed you could take the torch I been holding out for you<br>
                And hell, invite me to your wedding, I’ll be your something blue</p>
 
    <p>I guess I should be happy that you found someone to love<br>
    Who, from the gutter of the world, knows that you’re outside and above<br>
    Who’s probably lived a lonesome life, looking high and low for you<br>
    Who, in so many words, can see you like I do </p>
 
    <p>And I guess I should feel relieved, rather than despised<br>
    To know I’m not the only one who can see what’s in your eyes<br>
    And to realize beyond any doubt, that there would have been no way<br>
    to be the one to say, “I do,” on your wedding day—</p>
 
    <p>for something old you got that memory of the two of us, alone<br>
                for something new you got that house I spose you’ll make into a home<br>
                for something borrowed you could take the heart I wore on my sleeve for you<br>
                and hell, invite me to your wedding—I’ll be your something blue</p>
 
    <p>it may be too late to tell you now what maybe never needed sayin<br>
    I may’ve missed the opportunity when you caught that outbound train<br>
    All I’ve got now to look forward to’s a lifetime of time to kill<br>
    because I loved you then, and now, and always will </p>
 
    <p>and I spose there must be moments, like the spokes on fortune’s wheel,<br>
    when the broken things within us will begin again to feel<br>
    when the broad daylight of morning will again seem warm and soft<br>
    but for me, that day’s still a long ways off</p>
 
    <p>for something old you got that story from the madame’s crystal ball<br>
                for something new you got a family and a portrait on your wall <br>
                for something borrowed you could take my dreams which have always been of you<br>
                and hell, invite me to your wedding, I’ll be your something blue    </p>

    <h2>Backslidin</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The woman takin care of me takes care to never let me be<br>
    You know I’d go home but she’ll just be standing there<br>
    In the porchlight with her rolling pin, she’ll cross her arms, say “Where you been?”<br>
    I’ll say “I can’t say,” and she’ll say, “No, you tell me where,”<br>
    I’ll say “I can’t say,” and she’ll just sigh and frown<br>
    And I’ll try to sleep just knowing she’s still standing there <br>
    Thinking how every time she trusts me I just go and let her down</p>
 
    <p>The time it sure has slipped by fast, my curfew’s come and gone and passed<br>
    And my money all got spent before my tab was paid<br>
    With another night of streets to roam and anywhere to go but home<br>
    I’ll begin to wonder of the impact my impression’s made<br>
    I’ll begin to wonder if I been lost or found<br>
    I’ll begin to wonder just how far off the path I’ve strayed<br>
    And if it’s likely I could make it back if I just stopped and turned around</p>
 
    <p>But now I’m frightened, more of myself than of the thunder or the lightening<br>
                More of the dawn than of the night that knows no brightening, lets me keep on hidin<br>
                I know my wrongs need rightening, and tho I know when it’s just bait well I’m still bitin<br>
                The more I wait the more I feel the noose a tightenin, and the stakes’re heightening</p>
                            And tho I hardly feel the slack and know I won’t fall through the crack
                            I’m hardly gone before I’m back—backslidin
 
    <p>The preacher asks me if I pray, I tell him each and every day<br>
    He asks me, “How?”—as if he really didn’t know<br>
    I tell him first I close my eyes then I just kind of wait to be surprised<br>
    “And does that work?” he always wants to know<br>
    “And does what work?” I say for my response<br>
    “Are your prayers answered—does God say ‘yes’ and ‘no’?”<br>
    I tell him: “Father, God does whatever the hell he damn well wants.”</p>
 
    <p>I try to keep the leash on tight, try to do what’s good and just and right<br>
    And it’s not too hard, so long as no one’s keepin score<br>
    But somehow midway down the line I find I’m cursed by my own design<br>
    And its no use explaining what I do things for<br>
    And its no use trying to use my words<br>
    Cause all I say is something someone’s said somewhere before<br>
    And comes out sounding just like nothing that I ain’t already heard</p>
 
    <p>But now I’m frightened—more of my self than any madness I’m ignitin<br>
                More of my heart than of my love that needs requitenin, that feels your spitenin<br>
                I know my wrongs need rightenin, and tho I’m running low on fuel, well I’m still ridin<br>
                And tho I’ve broken every rule I was abidenin, seems no one’s mindin</p>
                            And tho it used to be an act, I used to do it just for laughs
                            Seems now the whole charade is cracked and I’m just back—backslidin
 
    <p>My teacher taught me to be sick of science and arithmetic<br>
    “What good,” I asked, “is any of this stuff anyways?”<br>
    He warned me with a tired scold that “if you don’t do as you’re told<br>
    Well, you’ll find out for yourself one of these days—<br>
    And you’ll find out just how far you can get,”<br>
    And I found out right away because I cursed him to his face<br>
    And only lately have I thought of it as something I regret</p>
 
    <p>The officer of my parole, he says I’m under his control<br>
    And that if I even laugh too loud, well, he’ll be at my side<br>
    I can feel his eyes upon my skin, I’d shut them out but they lock me in<br>
    They say, “You’re lucky,” but that ain’t quite been verified<br>
    They say, “You’re free again,” but that ain’t quite been proved<br>
    They had my story written out before I testified<br>
    And I was sentenced for I knew of what I’d even been accused</p>
 
    <p>And now I’m frightened, more of myself than any foe that I’ve been fightin<br>
                More of the truth than of the lies that they’ve been writing, they’re self-indicting<br>
                But my wrongs need rightening, and tho I know the fuse is close well I’m still firin<br>
                The gate that leads to my destruction’s ever-widenin, slowly closing in</p>
                            And tho I knew it for a fact when the cards were dealt the deck was stacked
                            I still went all in for a jack, and now I’m back—backslidin

    <p>You wake up in the morning and you’re still drunk from lastnight<br>
    There’s a tooth missin from your grin<br>
    You know you gotta get up but you can’t find the light<br>
    In fact you don’t even know whose bed you’re in<br>
                The woman beside you just whispered she loved you<br>
                Which you’re sure you must’ve misunderstood<br>
                All you need now’s a cold shower—a cold shower<br>
                A cold shower’ll do you good</p>
 
    <p>It’s the middle of summer and it’s a thousand degrees<br>
    There’s steam risin up from the street<br>
    The air conditioner’s broken and the icebox won’t freeze<br>
    There’s no place for you to get out of the heat<br>
                You race to the pool but you can’t get in it’s full<br>
                Of every person in your neighborhood<br>
                All you need now’s a cold shower—a cold shower<br>
                A cold shower’ll do you good</p>
 
    <p>You’ve bought into everything and you think it’s all swell<br>
    living safely in your American dream<br>
    you’ve been breathing in foul air so long you can’t even smell<br>
    you’ve never drawn a single breath that’s clean<br>
                given the chance to upgrade and enhance, you <br>
                hesitate, wondering whether you should<br>
                all you need now’s a cold shower—a cold shower<br>

    <h2>I Think I'm Comin Down With Something Serious</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I came here by request to see my cousin whose been ill<br>
    Intending to remain but a week or so<br>
    My very first day here, I came down with a chill<br>
    That was nearly seven years ago</p>
 
    <p>They put me in a room where a man had just expired<br>
    Of some disease of which I’m sure I’d never heard<br>
    They told me all about how much he’d been admired <br>
    And how sad it was his condition could not be cured—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus- I think I’m coming down with something serious<br>
                            I don’t know how long it’ll be before I’m over this
                            I think I’m coming down with something serious
                            I don’t know if I’ll be getting up again
 
    <p>I’m sweating like a pig but I could use another sheet<br>
    My temperatures somewhere around 103<br>
    This morning I woke up and then I fell right back to sleep<br>
    When I opened up my eyes I could not see</p>
 
    <p>There’s a man here with a cough so bad he cannot talk<br>
    Just hacks and wipes his blood off in his sleeve<br>
    I asked the nurse, “How long before I get to see the doc?”<br>
    she pointed at him and said, “That’s the man you want to see,”</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Today I got a call from my boss back down below<br>
    He said I was due back at work—or else!<br>
    But I worked all my life, and what have I got to show?<br>
    As of now, I haven’t even got my health</p>
 
    <p>They put me on a cart and wheeled me to a room<br>
    where they strapped me to an old X-ray machine<br>
    everyone agreed that something must be done—and soon!<br>
    but they never told me what any of it means<br>
                chorus</p>
 
    <p>There’s a girl here from Duluth, she cannot speak a word<br>
    She communicates through shapes made with her hands<br>
    Whenever she’s around, I feel a pounding in my nerves<br>
    I get dizzy, weak, and cannot seem to stand—</p>
 
    <p>They listened to my heart, they opened up my veins<br>
    They looked inside my blood for some kind of sign<br>
    The nurse reported back that my heartbeat was just the rain<br>
    And it turns out my own blood ain’t even mine—</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Yesterday I wrote a letter out on the lawn<br>
    “Dear Uncle,” it said, “Sorry I misspoke.<br>
    If you reading these words now, it means that I am gone<br>
    And no, I don’t mean, stepped out for a smoke.</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been the child of privilege, known prosperity and wealth;<br>
    Please take my things and give them to the poor.<br>
    If you’d like to keep my books, please—go, and help yourself<br>
    Where I’m going—I won’t need them anymore”</p>

    <h2>Storm Beyond the Calm</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 9</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I had a girl I loved her madly; towards me her feeling was lukewarm<br>
    Later on I learned she had me in the calm before the storm<br>
    I thought that love would last forever, but I could not have been more wrong<br>
    You can’t dress for the weather in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>I aint been here in a long time, tho I guess not much has changed<br>
    There’s still a beauty in the lightning, there’s still a comfort in the rain<br>
    They say the night is always darkest the hour before the dawn<br>
    And love stands at its starkest in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>I tried livin in the city, but I couldn’t find a friend<br>
    So I moved into the country, started talking to the wind<br>
    Now I toil in my pasture, and I sleep out on the lawn<br>
    And I feel right at home here, in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>I been up and down the mountain, I trudged through the desert dunes<br>
    I drank from pleasure’s fountains, and howled at bluer moons<br>
    But there’s no gold in el dorado, and in gilead’s no balm<br>
    You’re stuck waiting for tomorrow in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>And there’s no one to write home to from freedom’s giant cage<br>
    Everyone that claims to know you just turns your anger into praise<br>
    Goliath wants a rematch, but David’s busy with his psalms<br>
    Words are useful as a wet match in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>So I guess I’ll keep a goin down the road that’s got me lost<br>
    Leaning gainst the breezes blowin, weighing the spoils against the cost<br>
    I tried admitting I was weak once, but I’ve never been that strong</p>
                                                                In the storm beyond the calm
 
    <p>I been out on a short limb when the branches have been sawn<br>
    I brushed against the heavens seen the gorges neath me yawn<br>
    Death can grin to hear my laughter, but I’ll sing another song<br>
    And survive one more disaster in the storm beyond the calm    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Just a traveler—on a road<br>
    Making good time; making head-way to nowhere at all<br>
    Left my footprints—where it snowed<br>
    That’s as good as any farewell letter I could scrawl<br>
                I mouthed the words I could not say—as tho I thought I could undo <br>
                The choice to stand and stay remains—tho it is I who have now forsaken you<br>
    An empty feelin burns me through—I can’t waiver<br>
    I can’t linger in this moment anymore<br>
    With midnight stealing into blue—my whole horizon<br>
    Is disappearing in a sudden blur<br>
                I rapped upon the frosted glass—wherein my gaunt reflection shone<br>
                When I climbed in the cabbie asked—“Where have you been, </p>
                                                                                                    but first, tell me where you goin?” 
    <p>CHORUS: I wanna go home—home—<br>
                                        Home—that’s where I wanna go 
 
    <p>Breakfast table—a broken plate, mama’s bathrobe<br>
    Dragging dirty round her ankles on the floor<br>
    A stream of boxcars hauling freight, and November<br>
    coming early and unwelcome through the door<br>
                I woke up inside a bus that had carved all night to make it through a storm<br>
                I’s just in time to see the fog rise up from out of the Pennsylvania corn <br>
    No tomorrows—in this town<br>
    Just a motel with its neon flashing “Vacant” in the cold<br>
    must be shrinking—these things down <br>
    in my memory, either that or else I’m just getting old<br>
                I found a sign that read “free meal” and pressed upon a door to see<br>
                I nearly cried when the waitress come and asked me: Son, what’ll it be? </p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>I been to Nashville, outer space, Oklahoma<br>
    Now I’m sitting in my Philadelphia room<br>
    Trying to read things I’ve erased, or written over<br>
    Or told myself I’d reckon pretty soon—<br>
                Barring not that I should fail, still I—have struggled to resist<br>
                the thought that where I’m trying to land may well not even exist<br>
    Life’s a strange sort of museum—full of routines<br>
    Full of desperate efforts catapulting loss <br>
    So many visions—you can’t believe em—til its too late<br>
    Til your faith wears the same odor as exhaust<br>
                I clicked my heels three times and prayed—to a God I could not see<br>
                I stamped and addressed myself so the postman would know exactly where to deliver me</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>Just a traveler on a road making good time; making headway to nowhere at all<br>

    <h2>Since You Left (Ain't Nothin Been the Same)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The water tastes like metal and the coffee tastes like paint<br>
    And everything I eat these days makes me want to faint<br>
    I went to see my doctor and I told him my complaint<br>
    He said it ain’t your tongue that’s broken, it’s your brains—<br>
                It gives me cause to wonder, or should I say, to doubt<br>
                Whether its even blood that’s flowin in my veins<br>
                Everything was goin one way now it goes a different route<br>
                And since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>The colors on my pallet have all gone and changed their hue<br>
    My yellows ain’t so yellow and my blues are darker blue<br>
    The poetry inside my books just doesn’t ring as true<br>
    Each familiar thing now strikes me as strange<br>
                Everywhere the sun is shining but a clouds formed over me<br>
                And I moved here just to get out of the rain<br>
                I don’t know if it’s a secret plot or some conspiracy<br>
                But since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>The windshield’s got a crack now and the front door’s got a creak<br>
    The lamp it has a busted bulb and the faucet’s sprung a leak<br>
    And my entire outlook onto life’s grown pretty bleak<br>
    I spent my mornings watching things go down the drain<br>
                I don’t know if it’s coincidence, bad luck or even fate<br>
                Tho I’m afraid I’m hardly able to explain<br>
                The smallest shred of sense I can’t configure or create<br>
                But since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>Rivers used to lead to oceans, now they flow right to their source<br>
    Birds used to fly south in the winter, now they’re headin north<br>
    Time, she walked a tightrope, now she’s swining back and forth<br>
    No sand inside the hourglass remains<br>
                I’m still fighting the old demons, the Mondays and the blues<br>
                Tho the upper hand I no longer seem to gain<br>
                All the things I once relied on now reject me or refuse<br>
                And since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>My feet, they roam the ceiling, and my head, it scrapes the floor<br>
    Today I tried to go outside but I coulnd’t reach the door<br>
    I don’t think the laws of gravity are workin anymore<br>
    What goes down once can still go down again<br>
                But don’t worry bout me darling I think I’m starting to get well<br>
                I’m sure that someday it’ll all be plain<br>
                You came to me so gently that the change was hard to tell<br>
                But since you left ain’t nothing been the same<br>
    I’m easily distracted, my mind is all off track<br>
    I still think of you from time to time, wonder if you’re comin back<br>
    I left a candle burning and a key under the mat<br>
    With a note on which I didn’t put your name<br>
                If you come acallin for me and I don’t answer right away<br>
                It ain’t because I’m angry or detained<br>
                Probably I’m just trine to think of something new to say<br>
                Cause since you left ain’t nothing been the same    </p>

    <h2>Hell of a Day I'm Havin</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Woke up this morning to a rooster crowing<br>
    The sails were set but the wind wasn’t blowing<br>
    It was the middle of june and it was already snowing<br>
    I should’ve known something was wrong</p>
 
    <p>Rolled out of be put my shirt on backwards<br>
    Pulled my pants on first and my underwear aftwards<br>
    Slipped on the stairs made a whole in the plaster<br>
    Right where your portrait belonged</p>
 
    <p>Went down to the kitchen to make a pot of coffee<br>
    I poured it, stirred it, then spilled it on me<br>
    Went to make it again but the can was empty<br>
    All I could do was scowl</p>
 
    <p>It seems like I can’t do anything right<br>
                I go to bed early lay awake all night<br>
                I’m afflicted by forces that I just can’t fight<br>
                Might as well throw in the towel</p>
 
                            But what a hell of a day I’m havin     
                            If this is some kinda joke, man, I ain’t laughin
                            I know worse things have been known to happen
                            But they ain’t been known to happen to me
 
    <p>Drivin to work my front wheel exploded<br>
    It seems the tire pressure had been overloaded<br>
    That the fault was mine has been duly noted<br>
    The tow-man told me so</p>
 
    <p>Got into the office a little behind schedule<br>
    My boss thought my tardiness was intentional<br>
    Said the time’s come for me to do what’s sensible<br>
    Gave me the old heave-ho</p>
 
    <p>Got home early met my girlfriend leavin<br>
    Said she didn’t have time to go into the reasons<br>
    Said that there was something else that she was needin<br>
    I said “What about me?” she said, “No—”</p>
 
    <p>And it feels like I can’t keep anything straight<br>
                I pay up-front face-value at the goin-rate<br>
                But its always just a little too little too late<br>
                Either too fast or much too slow</p>
                            Chorus
 
    <p>Preachers and teachers, they taunt and test me<br>
    The neighbors complain and the cops arrest me<br>
    And every person I’ve ever loved has left me<br>
    What’s that supposed to say about me?</p>
 
    <p>I was disinvited to a colleague’s wedding<br>
    It seems I couldn’t prevent an ugly rumor from spreading<br>
    I receieved a memorandum with the following heading<br>
    You and me, pistols at dawn</p>
 
    <p>I showed up late but I brought my seconds<br>
    We shook hands quickly and chose our weapons <br>
    Threw up a coin and it just went on flippin<br>
    Til all our hard feelings was gone</p>
 
    <p>Seems like I can’t follow anything thru<br>
                I wake up from a nightmare and it just comes true<br>
                Meanwhile everything beautiful reminds me of you<br>
                Like a star I keep wishin on</p>
 
                            Chorus
 
    <p>New York Times said the end was nearing<br>
    Paper hit my porch as the smoke was clearing<br>
    I’s trine to decide if the sound I’s hearing<br>
    Was in or outside of my head</p>
 
    <p>Sun came out around eleven thirty<br>
    I tried to see through the flames but my glasses were dirty<br>
    I cried out for help but nobody heard me<br>
    They probably all thought I was dead</p>
 
    <p>I dragged myself out of the smoldering rubble<br>
    Out of the frying pan headed for trouble<br>
    Spent my life on the sea, just to drown in a puddle<br>
    I swear you couldn’t make this stuff up</p>
 
    <p>I just can’t make up my lost mind it seems<br>
                Whether I’m goin or coming apart at the seems<br>
                I might be a ghost you know that all that it means<br>
                Is that I just can’t let go</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>

    <h2>The Whereabouts of His Forgotten Mistress</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>So you’ve finally made your peace with those you used to go ahead and make your wars with<br>
    I knew you had it in you babe to lay down your sword upon the shield you prayed and swore with<br>
    Tell me, can you name the thing it was that made you want to go and change your old ways for forever?<br>
    Were you makin adjustments just now when you saw me, or were you just trine to prove that you were clever?</p>
 
    <p>Last we met as I recall you inquired of the whereabouts of your old lover<br>
    A man they called by many names and titles that changed as he roamed from one town into another<br>
    Your man I know I met one night though I admit it only was in passin<br>
    I asked him straight up who he was and like you said he would, he asked me who was askin</p>
 
    <p>I said to take his pick of names, he could call me what he liked for all it mattered<br>
    He gestured to a curtain near a window the behind of which a mirror had been shattered<br>
    We were in the this hotel bar and seemed the only travelers there who needed restin<br>
    I could tell he crawled a thousand miles by his feeble face and the beggars rags he dressed in </p>
 
    <p>For a time we spoke of nothing and only said the things that never needed sayin<br>
    Of how he never meant to leave but had to get back to fleein from the debts that needed payin<br>
    He said he sposed you’d sent me to find out what became of that widowed heart’s disaster<br>
    He said a thing to say to you I couldn’t hear over the thunder’s raging laughter</p>
 
    <p>So now I’ve circled back to you, you know that you’re as hard to find as he is<br>
    I tried to trace the love you lost and all I got for clues are my own ideas<br>
    But what I still can’t figure out is why you want so bad to know he’s out of rations<br>
    As if to know he’d settled down and were fine somewhere were the worst thing you could imagine</p>
 
    <p>I’ve crossed the deserts wild and come within an inch of the maw of the volcano<br>
    I’ve poured the legends tall and drunk them deep and know as well they never stay the same though<br>
    Been up and down and lost and found and run around back and forth all across the country<br>
    I’ve consumed what’s been presumed to be too much, stood up and still been hungry</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t mean to speak for you, for who am I but a lowly bounty hunter<br>
    I’ve been paid to make my way and find out what I can by the contract that I’m under<br>
    But if you could within your heart try to make a place that wasn’t such a prison<br>
    Perhaps you’d have no need of me and we could both of us just get back to livin    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>How’m I supposed to know that you’re angry?<br>
    How’m I supposed to know you’re unhappy?<br>
    How’m I supposed to know that it ain’t my fault?</p>
 
    <p>You’ve spoken your piece and look, you’ve gone silent<br>
    Put down your fists, no need to get violent<br>
    You opened the wound, and now you’re just adding salt<br>
    Til the whole conversation’s been ground to a screeching halt</p>
 
    <p>Honestly—<br>
                I can’t see—<br>
                how you ever got to be—so like a rock<br>
                That short of a contract deal—<br>
                that don’t make anything anymore real—<br>
                somehow you still feel—</p>
                                                    You can’t even talk—to me
 
    <p>You’re never around on the evenings or weekends<br>
    Your secrets unfold as your mystery deepens <br>
    the crease of your letter was known to be uncommonly sharp</p>
 
    <p>I’m past any hope or cry of remembering<br>
    like a ripening tear in the duct, you’ve been trembling<br>
    but tell me again, and forgive me—I’m still in the dark<br>
    I can see now what Time will do, yes, it’s left its mark </p>
 
    <p>& I’ve been briefed<br>
                Not to turn over a new leaf<br>
                Cause it won’t bring no release—to a way that’s been blocked<br>
                But can’t you understand<br>
                It’ll be out of my hands<br>
                How you gonna make any new demands</p>
                                                    If you don’t talk—to me?
 
    <p>I tiptoed around and I bent over backwards<br>
    Walking on eggshells, I examined your hazards<br>
    Raking your bed of coals just brought me to thin ice— </p>
 
    <p>So take all the time in the world that you’re needing<br>
    I’ll be alright, it’s not like I’m bleeding<br>
    Go and be a good to yourself for once in your life<br>
    You don’t need my permission, you don’t even gotta think twice<br>
                I’ve been advised<br>
                Not to apologize<br>
                Tho I don’t think it’s wise—and frankly I’m shocked<br>
                That that could be so clear<br>
                To someone who ain’t right here<br>
                Who don’t know the fear—that you’ve apparently got<br>
                And I don’t want to pry<br>
                I don’t want to be “that guy”<br>
                Cause I know you’re shy—and I guess I’m not<br>
                But I’m on my knees<br>
                It’s my only need<br>
                Please, please, please—won’t you talk—to me?     </p>

    <h2>It's You (You're Grieving Now)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Time passes so slow when you’re trying to rise—and you’re sinkin<br>
    You wish you were moving on, but you got nowhere to be—and you’re thinking<br>
    You grieved with everything you had<br>
    Every beat of heart you could allow—<br>
    But even doing it all for him<br>
    In the end still wasn’t enough somehow—</p>
                            cause it’s you—
                            It’s you—                                                                    —you’re grievin now
 
    <p>The record’s stuck in the groove, repeating a phrase—and you let it<br>
    The young man is making his move, he gives you his word—you forget it<br>
                You’re still hung up on a choice you made<br>
                That you’d’ve undone if time had allowed<br>
                But even if he were here<br>
                Don’t you think he’d be able to point it out: </p>
                            That its you—
                            Its you—you’re grieving now
 
    <p>The faucet’s screwed to the sink, it ain’t going noplace—but its drippin<br>
    The rope’s tied fast to the weight swinging high overhead—but it’s slippin<br>
                You know you shouldn’t feel bad<br>
                And you tell yourself like you was making a vow<br>
                Your sorrow’s the size of your love for him<br>
                Just like you always knew it was, somehow</p>
                            But it’s you—
                            It’s you—you’re grieving now
 
    <p>Once you’d do anything to relieve all the pain—you were feeling<br>
    But now you can’t bear to think that numb’s all you are—and you’re healing  <br>
                 Perhaps there’s been some mistake<br>
                It’s all been an act, and here comes the bow—<br>
                The dead will exit the stage<br>
                Leaving the audience better off somehow</p>
                            But it’s you—
                            It’s you—you’re grieving now

    <h2>Losing You</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>It’s been a while now since the last time we talked<br>
    But I been tracing your footsteps in the paths that we walked<br>
    And I been kicking myself cause opportunity knocked—<br>
                And I didn’t know that it was my cue</p>
 
    <p>And I’m remembering things that I shouldn’t’ve said<br>
    Thinking bout what I could’ve told you instead<br>
    It makes me wish sometimes that I were actually dead<br>
                Rather than merely regretful and blue</p>
 
    <p>The cracks of my fingers the rain’s fallin through<br>
                What is it exactly you want me to do?<br>
                Maybe I’m losing my sane point of view</p>
                            But it feels like—I don’t know
                            It feels like—I don’t know
                            It feels like I’m losing you—
                            It feels like I’m losing you
 
    <p>you changed all your habits to suit your new friends<br>
    To whom you were never more than a means to an end<br>
    You’re much further gone than even you can pretend<br>
                Yet you make believe none of it’s new </p>
 
    <p>And you stand by and watch as your handiwork spoils:<br>
    As your patience expires and your temperature boils<br>
    and from your tenderest gesture the medusa recoils<br>
                as if to say it already knew</p>
 
    <p>I’ve examined the floorplan the architect drew<br>
                Seems its somekind of labyrinth we’ve been wandering through<br>
                And maybe I’ve lost the thread that this needle went to</p>
                            but it feels like—I don’t know 
                            it feels like—I don’t know
                            it feels like I’m losing you 
 
    <p>you take on too much, you’re like a martyr at dusk<br>
    the things that you once believed in you no longer trust<br>
    the machinery to help you has taken on rust<br>
                and you’ve bitten off more than you can chew</p>
 
    <p>But when I saw you this morning—you seemed in a good place<br>
    You had a spring in your step and a smile on your face<br>
    I thought you’d be shipwrecked but it wasn’t the case<br>
                I wondered just what had come over you?</p>
 
    <p>this war has been raging too long now, it’s true<br>
                what was my little big horn was your waterloo  <br>
                sure, maybe I won me a battle or two<br>
                but it feels like—I don’t know<br>
                it feels like—I don’t know<br>
                it feels like I’m losing you<br>
                it feels like I’m losing you     </p>

    <p>Got no money in the bank; got no gas inside my tank<br>
    I’ve only got myself to thank that I’ve got nothing left to lose<br>
    But even if I owned a stitch, somehow got lucky, struck it rich<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>The doctor he reviewed my chart, the nurse she listened to my heart<br>
    They asked me bout my history and then both of them withdrew<br>
    I’m told that they’re comparing notes, but I still ain’t been diagnosed<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>The judge he made the jury rise, recite the verdict, improvise<br>
    It came as no surprise to me that nobody had a clue<br>
    The prosecution made a move for what nobody had to prove<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>King Solomon he did command that every person in the land<br>
    Should be rounded up and counted with the riches he’d accrued<br>
    When he’d totaled all that he owned, he just hung his head and moaned:<br>
    Lord knows, I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>There came a crying from the earth, there was a death, there was a birth<br>
    I neither could determine nor decide just what was true<br>
    The only thing I know for sure, hatred dies, love endures<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>When in trouble hope for change, if in doubt pray for rain<br>
    When in Rome, the tourists say, do as the Romans do<br>
    But if you won’t give me this dance, please allow me just one more chance<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>Bridges: You’re the only thing that keeps me on the even keel<br>
                            Who tells it like it is when it just don’t seem for real
                            You’re the bridge over the highway of a life that I ain’t crossed
                            Without you I am no one, I am nowhere, I am lost
    <p>You’re the reason anything in this crazy world makes sense<br>
                            Without you life’s a catalogue of random accidents
                            Causes that have nothing t’all to do with their effects
                            Dots scattered in a universe that no one else connects

    <h2>Keepin Busy</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Friday night, my baby came home just as tired as could be<br>
    I asked her how her day was she said she didn’t want to talk to me<br>
    I said how come and she got mad, said cause she was all worn out<br>
    And she comes home to find me here sleeping on the couch</p>
 
    <p>I said, Baby, Darlin—you know I ain’t been here all day<br>
    I been busy too you know while you have been away<br>
    “Oh really?” she said, “Is that so? Well in that case I’d love to hear<br>
    Just all about the things you did while I wasn’t here”</p>
 
    <p>I did the laundry, the dishes, I filed the taxes / sent out my resume with necessary attachments<br>
    I swept, scraped and mopped the floor / fixed the old hinge on that creaky cellar door<br>
    I sent a get well card to your ailing brother, I called and spoke with your ex-step-mother<br>
    She said to tell you she’s doin fine, I told her you’d give her a call sometime<br>
    I raked the leaves, cleaned out the gutters, painted the door-frames and the window-shutters  <br>
    I filled out applications for a half-dozen jobs, groomed the cat and walked the dog<br>
    I borrowed a mower from the next door neighbor / cut the grass in our yard and in his, as a favor<br>
    I cleaned the garage, the attic, the basement / retarred the driveway with quality pavement<br>
    I got the kids up, dressed em, made em breakfast / took one to the doctor, one to the dentist<br>
    I made their lunches, and gottem to school, picked em up and took em to the swimming pool<br>
    I made a list and went grocery shopping, ran seven miles without even stopping<br>
    Somewhere in there, I pulled a muscle, did a whole Sunday Times crossword puzzle <br>
    I entertained visitors, gave em a tour, I found that lost earring you been looking for<br>
    I took out the garbage, brought in the mail, I sold a lot of your junk at a neighbor’s yardsale <br>
    I hung your portraits after getting them framed, I organized the spice rack alphabetically by name<br>
    I vacuumed and dusted every room and surface, gave every useless trinket a purpose<br>
    I found what was wrong with the garbage disposal, I proof-read and edited your meeting proposal<br>
    I cooked your favorite meal: vegetable lasagna, set the table and then waited on ya<br>
    I went to the post office and then to the bank, went to the gas station, filled up the tank <br>
    Then I came back home and cracked open a beer, and that’s the whole story of how I got here<br>
                And look, I know it don’t look like I done too much, and I haven’t, don’t get me wrong—<br>
                But I been keepin busy, trine to keep from goin crazy—<br>
                Yes, I been keepin busy, since you been gone </p>
 
    <p>But it was no use, all my explanations, they were to no avail<br>
    Time after time, again and again it seems no matter what I do, I fail<br>
    She said she was very sorry, but she didn’t see us working out<br>
    And just like that she showed me the door and said, “Alright now, get out!”</p>
 
    <p>For a while I was miserable, I couldn’t seem to catch a break<br>
    I didn’t know how much worse it could get, or how much more I could take<br>
    Then one day she called me up, said it had been too long a time<br>
    When she asked me how I was doin, I told her I was just fine</p>
 
    <p>I invented my very own dietary supplement, I took up yoga, achieved enlightenment,<br>
    I burned all those letters that I never sent you, finally read all those books I meant to,   <br>
    I got membership cards to every local library, I memorized the Oxford English Dictionary<br>
    I rented every movie at the video store, watched em all twice, some three times, some four<br>
    I joined a gym, lost a few-dozen pounds, believe me it was a lot harder than it sounds, <br>
    I rode my bike all across the country, saw how folks was living in the 21st century<br>
    I worked some farms and at a couple of factories, water treatment plants, fishing hatcheries<br>
    I grew my hair out, then shaved it short—let’s see what else is there to report <br>
    I learned to count cards, took up gambling, traveled all over, roaming and rambling<br>
    I started a business with the money I won, then sold it to invest in another one<br>
    I went back to school got my degrees, my bachelor’s, master’s and a phD<br>
    I was nominated for a couple awards for accomplishing the things I’d put my mind towards <br>
    I finally learned how to cook and to bake, there’s practically nothing now that I can’t make<br>
    I apologized to every person I’d wronged, finished my memoire, wrote a few songs<br>
    I penned several drafts of my last testament will, Lord knows I’ve sure had some time to kill <br>
                But say how are you doing with your new life? Looks like you’ve merrily been getting along<br>
                Yes, well I been keepin busy, trine to keep from going crazy<br>
                Yes I just been keepin busy since you been gone    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 9</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Now I am a taker in this hard-up world, the fortune-teller told me first<br>
    She proved it to me when I took her word for every penny it was worth <br>
    to this day I still can’t say how it all first came to her so clear<br>
                when way back then I was on my way—to anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>I’s born a long ways from my home, but I been bound there ever since<br>
    And I’s made to walk the road alone, in fact, I’ve leapt at every chance<br>
    I’ve lost count of both my friends and foes, I can’t keep track of every fallen tear<br>
                Good and bad, they come and go—they’re with you anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>some folks they live in stacks of brick, some in cities of cement<br>
    for a long time I was most at home whichever way the railroad went<br>
    and every time that station whistle’d call, the sound was music to my ear<br>
                the trains they come from no place at all, bound for anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>It was easy going for a while, I’d say—that is, until the road got rough<br>
    And I earned my money in a honest way, until I didn’t have enough<br>
    When the time was ripe to make a break, my engine stalled in second gear<br>
                I might’ve settled for a simpler fate, one that put me anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>well I found myself in some trucker bar where the beer was pretty cheap<br>
    I drank my fill and went to pay and learned my purse was not so deep<br>
    They took what I owed them out of my flesh and threw me out upon my ear<br>
                Said I was welcome back anytime—that is, anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>I always dreampt I’d wind up some place, where all there’d be is time to kill<br>
    But where I’m from dreams get replaced by working dayshift at the mill<br>
    And the work is hard, and when you’re through, you look back on your career<br>
                The old men say it’s all okay—somewhere, anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>I swear there’s nothing I got left in store, I won’t hand you no excuse<br>
    Please just don’t hit me anymore, I can’t take no more abuse<br>
    yesterday’s is too far gone, and tomorrow’s never near<br>
                you can’t never change the road you’re on—when you’re not anywhere but here </p>
 
    <p>I’s never much of a praying man, the Lord I’d never cause to fear<br>
    But if you’re somewhere up there, Old Man, here’s one prayer I hope you hear<br>
    If I go gently in the night, or hard, falling down upon my spear<br>
                lord, when I die, please just see that I—wind up anywhere but here    </p>

    <p>How you gonna stand there and act like it don’t matter<br>
    When with every passin second here, I’m just getting sadder?<br>
                You don’t owe me anything, your debt’s as good as paid<br>
                You don’t gotta follow through on any of the plans you made<br>
                You can come out from your hiding place, pick up the traps you’ve laid</p>
                            Everywhere throughout these fields of clover
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and tell me you still love me<br>
    When all the while you just been holding sharp and heavy things above me?<br>
                You can take down your battleflag, saddle up your mule<br>
                Put your needle in the cactusplant, and the thread back on the spool<br>
                You don’t have to be afraid now, baby, you can play it cool</p>
                            Resume your role as the ice queen of October
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and ask me now for money<br>
    And say, what are you laughin for, do you think that this is funny?<br>
                You said you’d always be there for me anytime no matter what<br>
                You said you’d come and save me if I needed you to, but<br>
                I can see that what was in your heart’s just moved into your gut</p>
                            You don’t have to get clean for me, or sober
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and pretend you didn’t do it<br>
    When you had it comin to me the whole time and you knew it         <br>
                I don’t have expectations anymore ever since I’ve gotten wise<br>
                To your elaborate deceptions which you so cleverly disguise<br>
                You think you’re seein clearly but you got wool over your eyes</p>
                            You needn’t look to see what’s just behind your shoulder
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and say things’ll all be different<br>
    When you don’t have the heart to say it ain’t good when it isn’t?<br>
                I’m no longer keeping promises—it’s never done me any good<br>
                All that being honest’s shown me is that I’ve never understood<br>
                I did it all correctly but my reputation’s in the mud</p>
                            I’m not making anymore unwarranted disclosures
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and make like you’re the victim?<br>
    When you went out looking for a fight, you found em and you picked em?<br>
                Considering the circumstance, it’s a wonder you don’t feel<br>
                A little more responsible for your part in the deal<br>
                The water flows beneath the bridge, and fortune turns her wheel</p>
                            I’m not getting any younger here, only older
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and just tell me to forget it?<br>
    When it’ll turn into the end of the whole world if you let it?<br>
                The credits here are rolling everybody’s free to leave<br>
                You played the game by all the rules and you got your reprieve<br>
                You outghtta be more cheerful you got no reason to greive</p>
                            You don’t have to stand there stone-faced like a soldier
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and say this ain’t the ending?<br>
    Do you mean to say that all along this time you were pretending?<br>
                I’d prefer it if you didn’t drag this out into a scene<br>
                You don’t have to clarify, we both know what you mean<br>
                You can take what’s left of what you own, there’s nothing else to clean</p>
                            You can leave the coals inside the stove to smolder
                                        Now—that it’s over

    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Midnight on the boulevard, you know that I been looking hard<br>
    For someplace I can rest my bones<br>
    The dumpster’s growing tentacles and the alley’s drawing animals <br>
    And my shoes are filling up with stones<br>
    headlights all around me flash and splash and try drown me<br>
    as invisibly I make my way<br>
    billboards, with their promises of futures bleak and ominous<br>
    saying everything’s gonna be okay<br>
    there’s holy men in beggar’s clothes, schoolgirls in their pantyhose<br>
    policemen dressing for the raid<br>
    anyplace I sit or stand I’m in the way of the marchingband<br>
    or some exclusive VIP parade<br>
    Got a ticket to ride the rocket putting a hole right through my pocket <br>
    They say they’ve got her loaded, gassed and primed<br>
    With nothing else to recommend, and no regards to leave or send <br>
    I think I’ll go and get in line<br>
    If tomorrow I just disappeared,<br>
                I’m not sure that I’d be missed                       <br>
    The answer’s not a part of me<br>
    I only know there’s gotta be more to life than this</p>
 
    <p>The sheriff and his band of droogs is out tonight in one of their moods<br>
    They say they’re looking for the saboteurs<br>
    Nobody seems to know a thing, and as for the fellas in the ring<br>
    They’s just settling up old scores<br>
    Diamond Joe and his brother Ace spoke of meeting up someplace<br>
    As an act of service to their queen<br>
    They’d been assigned a mission that may have required demolition<br>
    By now they’re probably blown to smithereens<br>
    There’s blood smeared on the mantlepiece of every house on Market St<br>
    I’ve heard it’s precautionary for the plague<br>
    But as for how it’s sposed to help, you gotta figure that one out yourself<br>
    The instructions left were pretty vague<br>
    You can follow the road to nowhere or you can take it from one who’s been there<br>
    who drank the kool-aid from the source<br>
    haul in your anchor, hoist your sails, don’t look back, if all else fails<br>
    shout for “Mercy!” til your voice goes hoarse<br>
    If tomorrow were all I had<br>
                I’d blow it one last lover’s kiss<br>
                I’m not one to act modestly<br>
                I only know there’s gotta be more to life than this— </p>
 
    <p>I got here around six o’clock, the breadlines already down the block<br>
    The hopeless ones have placed their bets<br>
    The early birds have all skipped town, the ones a little bit further down<br>
    don’t even know what they’re in line to get<br>
    The grocer’s peddling contraband with a stick of dynamite in his hand<br>
    He’s always asking for the time<br>
    We’ve been through the whole thing twice, but even if he lowered the price<br>
    Could anybody spare a dime?<br>
    Patience is a virtue, too much of anything will hurt you<br>
    Therefore—whatever’s a man to do?<br>
    I’m just waiting on my payday, but even so it’s only Monday<br>
    And I need something to look forward to<br>
    Disguised as one of my former selves, I followed the casino bells<br>
    dealer told me fate was mine to choose<br>
    I had the king, the ace, the ten, but I told him to go and hit me again<br>
    Cause I only ever play to lose<br>
                If tomorrow I struck it rich<br>
                I’m not sure I’d feel bliss<br>
                Accustomed to my poverty <br>
                I only know there’s gotta be more to life than this</p>
 
    <p>You can take pill to get out of bed, another one’ll clear your head<br>
    A third will get you out the door<br>
    I once had a prescription that fit precisely that description <br>
    If you need some, I can get some more—<br>
    There’s a drink to keep you awake all day, another to take the pain away<br>
    And another yet to help you get it back<br>
    There’s a problem solved by every drug, but as for never knowing love<br>
    I don’t know if I can help with that—<br>
    The doctor’s out, he called in sick, took something he thought would do the trick<br>
    But that was way back in july<br>
    His secretary says she’s his friend, but I’ve heard her tell a few since then<br>
    he’s just been waiting around to die <br>
    Left alone with his memories, transfixed in his reveries<br>
    The prisoner, in his cell, stands tall<br>
    Reflects upon coincidence, weighs the price of innocence<br>
    And adds another tally to his wall<br>
                If tomorrow, I walked out of here<br>
                I’d be happy just to exist<br>
                Meanwhile there’s a lotta me <br>
                That only knows there’s gotta be more to life than this</p>
 
    <p>feeling like a change of scene, I moved into a submarine<br>
    I tried to write you though I was feeling full<br>
    The envelopes, still unaddressed, accumulated in a chest<br>
    That I ejected through the torpedo hole<br>
    someday when I’m dust and ash, they may wash up like so much trash<br>
    decorations for some pristine beach<br>
    To whomsoever findeth these, I send sincere apologies <br>
    I’m still out here, somewhere, out of reach<br>
    With nothing but my strength of will, my boulder and my stretch of hill<br>
    I once more for the thousandth time<br>
    Set my weight against the rock, imagine, but don’t check the clock<br>
    And gradually begin to climb<br>
    In the event I plummet sometime before I reach the summit<br>
    I hardly think it’s worth a frown<br>
    When you’ve only ever had it bad, the only thing that’ll make you glad<br>
    Is seeing the weight you dragged up roll back down<br>
    If tomorrow I wake up dead<br>
                I’d not protest, but I’d still wish—<br>
                that someone had only thought of me<br>
                reminded me that there’s gotta be more to life than this     </p>

    <p>Foreman says its back to work, wants to see us live and movin<br>
    It’s no secret tho that he’s a jerk and this job it ain’t my choosin<br>
    It’s nine to nine on the ssembly line ain’t exactly that amusing<br>
    And we’ll probably all get us overtime, but that’s the weekend that we’re losin<br>
                Now I ain’t a one to make complaints, even when pushin comes to shoving<br>
                But I wished I had me another day for to sit round doing nothing</p>
 
    <p>On my one day off I slept in late didn’t get up until the evening<br>
    I cooked a meal, put it on a plate, but I couldn’t find the seasoning<br>
    So I drove my car to the grocery store, without forethought or reasoning<br>
    When I got there I found me a parking spot, steppin out I locked my keys in<br>
                For a minute I just stood there, all a red-faced and a cussin—<br>
                And I wished I had me another day for to sit round doing nothing</p>
 
    <p>In the summertime when the weather’s fine as well you may imagine<br>
    The sun it shines through my window-blinds where my eyelids are a-hatchin<br>
    Upon the beach I watch the sea where the waves come softly crashin<br>
    Against the crags beneath my seat where the mermaids are asplashin<br>
                Some days are meant for makin plans, and some days are for discussin<br>
                But me I tend to like the days where you can sit round doin nothing</p>
 
    <p>Out on the porch in my rocking chair with my pocket knife a whiddlin<br>
    Just enjoying nature’s outdoor air a hummin and a whistling<br>
    My sleeves are short and my feet are bare, I like to keep my toes a wigglin<br>
    When I run all out of wood to carve always got my thumbs for twiddling<br>
                No I don’t relate to people well, whether a stranger or my cousin<br>
                Folks always seem to want to do something else besides for nothing</p>
 
    <p>I had my eye on a pretty girl she was a one-in-a-twenty-million<br>
    I asked her for to marry me if she’d be so kind and willing<br>
    Well she didn’t say one word to me and just then something happened<br>
    She called a fella to come over here, and introduced me to her husband<br>
                He shook my hand so hard it hurt, and boy, was I a blushin<br>
                If I could’ve done it all again, I guess I would’ve never had said nothing</p>
 
    <p>When this life has gone and passed me by on my deathbed I’ll be dyin<br>
    And if I ain’t outlived the folks I know, haps around me they’ll be cryin<br>
    When the old man comes to reap my soul I won’t keep him long from tryin<br>
    I wouldn’t say that I’d be ready tho, if I did I would be lyin<br>
                My mind will rest from thinking sore and my heart will rest from lovin<br>
                But I’ll still wished I had me another day to sit round doing nothing    </p>

    <h2>A Brief Reflection Upon My Life to Date</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I am tired of trying to explain the reasons<br>
    For feelings I am powerless to understand<br>
    Sometimes I wish I could control the seasons<br>
                Or control my heartbeat<br>
                Or direct its yearning<br>
                That only something was not out of my hands<br>
    And I have been accused this way before by others<br>
    Like you I only wanted someone I could save<br>
    But if I am nothing but a coward now<br>
                And you may not believe this<br>
                And you do not have to<br>
                But it’s only because once I was much too brave</p>
                            For I have lived my life like a burning building
                            Like a rolling tide upon an ancient sea
                            And before I die, I only hope, God willing,
                            That I may learn what it is that I was meant to be
 
    <p>I have had my share of angry tantrums<br>
    The blazing furnace I have starved to cold<br>
    I gave myself where I wasn’t wanted <br>
                Revealed in earnest<br>
                What it was I needed<br>
                Took big chances<br>
                Hoped to get wise early but just got old<br>
    And I have steeled my heart for grave misfortune<br>
    In the quest for love and other ghosts<br>
    But such a preset hasn’t helped me any<br>
                I’ve been eluded<br>
                At almost every corner<br>
                Slowed and hindered<br>
                I’ve been stopped at boundaries<br>
                And sent away from almost every coast</p>
                            And I have lived my life like a wasted hour
                            On the station platform of a boarding train
                            And before I die I only hope god willing 
                            I may say that I did not live my life in vain
 
    <p>So at last I have come to the brink of something<br>
    Some valley or some sun must lie beyond these hills<br>
    I know I told you that someday I’d settle <br>
                Maybe down with someone<br>
                Maybe up with creditors<br>
                For maybe less than happiness<br>
                Or for more than sorrow<br>
                But I’m beginning to wonder if I ever will<br>
    I’ve prepared for this for many years now<br>
    To be ready for whatever’s coming with the storm<br>
                The hours late<br>
                Everyone is sleeping<br>
                The bells are silent<br>
                The stars are dying<br>
                The highway’s empty<br>
                The wind is rising<br>
                The dust is stirring <br>
                The chains are rattling<br>
                The babes are kicking waiting to be born</p>
                            And I have lived my life like a polished arrow
                            In the crowded quiver on a marksman’s back
                            And before I die I only hope, God willing 
                            That I may see that light before it all fades to black

    <h2>Every Morning</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I roll out of bed<br>
    got a thousand dreams and nightmares running through my head<br>
    not a one of which stays<br>
    my fears are no match for the exhaustion I’ve been feeling these days<br>
    behind me my love’s sleeping soundly<br>
    the bedsheet she clings to wraps half-way around me<br>
    she never seems to cease to astound me—even asleep<br>
                she stretches her arms and turns off the alarms which she’s set by the bed as a warning<br>
                but her eyes remain closed till the old rooster crows and the first rays of dawn shyly show</p>
                            Every morning
 
    <p>It’s pouring down sleet<br>
    Weatherman’s made all kinds of promises he just couldn’t keep<br>
    I’d sure hate to be him<br>
    If I expected any less than the worst I don’t know where I’d begin<br>
    I’d probably have to make a decision<br>
    Have to devise a clear position<br>
    I’d probably have to make it my mission not to be wrong<br>
                She says with a smile we’ll stay in for a while and let the weather outside go on storming<br>
                And if it never lets up we don’t have to get up, we’ll just carefully uninterrupt</p>
                            Every morning
 
    <p>I go for a walk<br>
    Buy a cup of coffee at the grocer’s where the tvs talk<br>
    A man says my name<br>
    He says, “And how are you today?” I tell him, “I’m the same.”<br>
    He says, “Are you quite sure about that?” I tell him, “I am, as a matter of fact,”<br>
    He says, “Hey, do you want your change back?” I say, “No.”<br>
                She says that it’s old but by the time she’s grown cold she’s already shown signs of warming<br>
                And her clothing is strewn all over my room as I lie in bed just waiting for noon</p>
                            Every morning
 
    <p>Lastnight is a blur<br>
    I don’t recall what we did, who we went with, or where we were<br>
    She don’t seem concerned<br>
    She says a night that’s best left forgotten is a lesson learned<br>
    At least that’s the way that she leaves it<br>
    When the newspaper comes she unwraps and she reads it<br>
    Occasionally she’ll say, “Aw, who needs it anyway?”<br>
                With a swell of her breath and one blow from her breath she keeps the frost on the windows from forming<br>
                And as suspicions accrue, her love remains true, and her mercy is new</p>
                            Every morning

    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>You can crawl in through my window<br>
    No one has to know you’re here<br>
    Mama’s tired cause she’s been working<br>
    If we’re quiet, she won’t hear<br>
                Dad’ll have the TV playin<br>
                He’ll be asleep fore long I’m sure<br>
                Baby crawl in through my window<br>
                You can leave through the front door</p>
 
    <p>You know sometimes I get the feelin<br>
    That you’ve been playin me for a fool<br>
    When I call you never answer<br>
    And you don’t talk to me at school<br>
                But every night that I come over<br>
                You say I’m the one you’re waiting for<br>
                Can’t you crawl in through my window<br>
                Like I’m always crawling out of yours?</p>
 
    <p>There’s an alley behind my building<br>
    You can get there through the gate<br>
    If you stand up on the trashcan<br>
    You can reach the fire escape<br>
                You can walk right up to my room<br>
                Apartment’s on the seventh floor<br>
                Baby crawl in through my window<br>
                And you can leave through the front door</p>
 
    <p>I know you built your reputation<br>
    Refusing what you’re supposed to be<br>
    You hate your parents and their station<br>
    That’s why you hang around with me<br>
                But you know there ain’t no pressure<br>
                The choice is obviously yours<br>
                But if you crawl in through my window<br>
                You can leave through the front door    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Said the head to the heart, “There is no cause to worry<br>
    There is no reason to fear<br>
    If you got something to tell her, man, well do it—but hurry<br>
    If you need I will be right here,”<br>
                Said the heart to the Head, “I wish it were so simple<br>
                I wish there were no obstructions or blocks<br>
                But I worry if I speak my tongue may stumble<br>
                And I will wind up the laughingstock…”<br>
    Said the head to the heart, “I will mind the tongue<br>
    I will outfit it with the cleverest phrase<br>
    I will compare her complexion to the golden sun<br>
    So that she will not fail to sing your praise,”<br>
                Said the heart to the Head, “I would it were so easy<br>
                A matter of knowing just what word to use<br>
                But if I reveal my desires and she doesn’t need me<br>
                Then the only chance I have, I’ll lose…”<br>
    Said the head to the heart, “Then I will keep them hidden<br>
    So that she will not suspect the truth<br>
    And if she happens to notice your pained expression<br>
    I will tell her it is in your tooth…”<br>
                Said the heart to the Head, “I wish it were so straightforward<br>
                As to be covered up by that disguise<br>
                But even if I tell her that my mouth is tortured<br>
                She will surely see it in my eyes…”<br>
    Said the Head to the Heart, “I will keep them closed, then,<br>
    So your love of her will not be known<br>
    And if she asks you please to let them open<br>
    I will play indifference like a stone,”<br>
                Said the Heart to the Head, “Would that it were no harder<br>
                Than pretending to be unaware<br>
                But the moment I attempt to disregard her<br>
                My lungs, they will want for air…”</p>
 
    <p>Said the heart to the head, “Will you keep me breathing<br>
                Will you keep my words from fading and receding? <br>
                Is our signal clear for you to keep receiving?<br>
                Shall I speak to her, head, now that she’s speaking?<br>
                Shall I pursue her, head, now that she’s leaving? <br>
                Can you hear me over that constant beating?<br>
                That sounds like a buffalo herd, stampeding?<br>
                Is this a question, head, that needs repeating?<br>
                Can you hear me over that constant beating? <br>
                did you hear what I said? Excuse me did you hear what I said?”<br>

    Of my death, when I am gone<br>
    Please break it to her soft and gently<br>
    Tell her that I suffered none</p>
 
    <p>O tell her that I’s aboard a freighter<br>
    Upon Superior, bound from Duluth<br>
    O tell her that our ship was sunken<br>
    But O please spare her the awful truth</p>
 
    <p>Or tell her that I’s in an aircraft<br>
    And that our plane fell from the sky<br>
    And if she asks to know what happened<br>
    Please see to it that you lie</p>
 
    <p>Please don’t let on I was in trouble<br>
    Or that I stole more than a dime<br>
    For if she knew how I was living<br>
    The shame would kill me a second time</p>
 
    <p>Please don’t let on I was unhappy<br>
    I often wrote her to say I’s well<br>
    There are some things one can’t help hiding<br>
    There are some things one should not tell</p>

    There’s none to keep her company<br>
    She had no one to put her faith in<br>
    Her hopes and dreams were all on me</p>
 
    <p>Now I have met three kinds of angels:<br>
    And two of them were heavenly<br>
    But twas the angel they call heroine<br>

    <p>I’ve not always heeded your sage advice which you’ve been given out to me since I was a kid<br>
    I know you’ve had to work hard, to sacrifice, so I could have all the chances that you never did<br>
                Nine times in ten you’ve been correct,<br>
                it seems I’ve been wrong ten in nine<br>
                You know I’m grateful, but with all due respect, <br>
                you haven’t let me ask for help in the longest time</p>
                            I know it’s hard to hear, it kinda hurts to say
                            But you gotta let me find my own way
 
    <p>I wasn’t cut out to fill your shoes, you know I’ve barely just grown into my own pair<br>
    You never said so, but you planted clues, enough for me to know you’ve always been right there<br>
                I know I’m not one from whom there’s much to expect<br>
                There’s a great deal between us we just don’t understand<br>
                I’m grateful for you, but with all due respect<br>
                I have no interest in the life you’ve planned</p>
                            So please I hope you don’t take this the wrong way
                            But you gotta let me find my own way 
 
    <p>I know you worry about just what I’ll do, when it comes to the future I’ve never looked ahead too far<br>
    Nothing I’ve done has been very well thought-through, with my debts and schemes and now, this old guitar<br>
                Your concerns they are not hard to detect<br>
                By now I can almost guess just what they’ll be<br>
                It’s not a bad thing, dad, but with all due respect<br>
                I wish you’d leave my problems up to me</p>
                            So if you would please, let come what may—
                            You gotta let me find my own way
 
    <p>The pioneers, their days are done; there are no new lands left to find<br>
    But every person, every single one, must learn this lesson in his own time<br>
                There is no telling of what ships I’ve wrecked<br>
                Of what precious chances I’ve let fall and break<br>
                But I gotta tell ya, with all due respect,<br>
                Those decisions were never yours to make</p>
                            I’m glad you’ve been here, but you won’t be here some day
                            You gotta let me find my own way

                Kind of reminds me of—myself<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself</p>
 
    <p>You got one foot on a banana peel<br>
    Other’s steppin out on a roller-skate<br>
    You’re so mixed up you don’t know how you feel<br>
    There’s none to whom you feel you can relate<br>
                The road your on’s just getting hillier<br>
                You tried it slow and fast, nothin’s helped<br>
                Something bout you, tho, seems familiar<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself</p>
 
    <p>Nothin lasts, everything falls apart<br>
    If not sooner, well, later, then<br>
    I’ve read all about the so-called “broken heart”<br>
    Examined a textbook specimen<br>
                It starts out warm, but just gets chillier<br>
                Eventually, it declines in health<br>
                There’s something bout it, seems familiar<br>
                Kind of reminds me of—myself<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself     </p>

    <p>If the flesh that hangs upon my bones should whither and decay<br>
    And Death      from stealing me                     no longer can abstain<br>
    If Time            decomposes me and a                         breeze blows me away<br>

    <p>If I give away all that I own, along with my body, to be burned<br>
    If I surrendered every ounce that I contain<br>
    If my wisdom walked out on me with every lesson I ever learned<br>
    My love for you<br>

    <p>At the very end when the world is done, and everything is past<br>

    <p>Further than the boundary of what you or I can know<br>

    Here, where you’ve already been, and wherever you may go<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you will remain</p>
 
    <p>Tomorrow, when you are wakened by the unassuming and rosey fingered dawn<br>
    And some birdsong comes up rising through your pane<br>
    Remember that tho I myself and every trace of me is gone<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you will remain    </p>

    <h2>The Poverty Line</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Roubles and Kopecks, 2020</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#roublesAndKopecks_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Chorus If I had a quarter for every time<br>
    Somebody told me to make up my mind<br>
    I would have enough money to be nickled and dimed<br>
    All the way back to the poverty line</p>
 
    <p>They tell me I’m poor cause I don’t like to work<br>
But I don’t see any rich folks with their hands in the dirt<br>
Show me a job where I won’t get hurt<br>
And I’ll show you a man who is eager to work</p>
 
    <p>They tell me I’m poor cause I spend all my cash<br>
I don’t have any savings, I can’t hoard a stash<br>
I get paid twice a month, it goes up in a flash<br>
Rent, groceries, insurance—well, you do the math<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>They say time is money and there’s plenty to earn<br>
But you gotta have some to begin with, to burn<br>
And the only lesson you’re able to learn<br>
Is that you can’t get ahead by just waiting your turn</p>
 
    <p>There’s a few of you up there who have all the best<br>
Your fiercest competitors couldn’t keep you abreast<br>
But some of us got nothing, most of us have less<br>
It’s take care of yourself—to hell with the rest<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>you say communism like it’s a bad word<br>
but capitalism ain’t the best one I’ve heard<br>
when you stop and think rationally, it’s kind of absurd<br>
you get richer and richer off the poor and conquered</p>
 
    <p>cause your politics works like a revolving door<br>
there’s a million rules and no one’s keeping score<br>
the rich think they’ve earned what they won at the door<br>
and what’s worse they believe that I choose to be poor<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>They tell me I’m poor because my investments aint wise<br>
I could’ve made millions, only I never tried<br>
But the distance from wealthy to here is too wide<br>
I’m starting to think maybe somebody lied</p>
 
    <p>Sure, I went to college, even got a degree<br>
but it didn’t do a whole hell of a lot of good for me<br>
education’s a blessing, but it sure isn’t free<br>
now I’ll be payin it off til I’m 103<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>you can go back to work or you can go back to jail<br>
but you don’t have the capital to get out on bail<br>
and you don’t have the money for any more ale<br>
and the ship you were waiting for just pulled up its sail</p>
 
    <p>so I’ll hoist myself up and I’ll put on my hat<br>
and I’ll just keep starving til I’m all out of fat<br>
if my options tween living like a bug or a rat<br>
well what in the hell kind of an option is that?<br>

    <p>I wouldn’t do it as a favor<br>
    I wouldn’t do it as a good Samaratin<br>
    I wouldn’t do it as your neighbor<br>
    I wouldn’t do it as your one and only friend<br>
                I wouldn’t do it for my family or my country<br>
                because I wanted or needed to—<br>
    I’m only in it for the money—<br>
    I hate to say it, but it’s true</p>
 
    <p>See the landlord turnin profit<br>
    turning out a family from their home<br>
    if you ask him why he doesn’t stop it<br>
    he’ll tell you go and leave me alone!<br>
    They come abused and broken and hungry— <br>
    I gave em four walls and a roof<br>
    I’m only in it for the money<br>
    That’s the sad but awful truth</p>
 
    <p>See the noble prosecutor<br>
    Making speeches for the jury sitting-by<br>
    Goin on about a shooter<br>
    Sayin every killer deserves to die<br>
                When he tells it, he tells it bloody<br>
                Without so much as one shred of substantial proof<br>
                But he’s only in it for the money<br>
                Doesn’t care at all about the truth</p>
 
    <p>Here comes your doctor to the rescue<br>
    he’s been on call and you know he hasn’t slept<br>
    he’s askin if the nurse has prepped you<br>
    and what kinds of outcomes you can expect<br>
                his hands are trembling as he makes ready <br>
                says, “if you don’t make it, this’ll be goodbye<br>
                I’m only in it for the money—<br>
                Is there any better reason why?”</p>
 
    <p>See the young entrepreneur<br>
    He’s invented something no one really needs<br>
    it’s somehow come to be quite popular<br>
    it’s catching on like wildfire overseas<br>
                to make it only costs a penny<br>
                the lives of those who buy it all get wrecked <br>
                but he’s only in it for the money<br>
                never mind the side effects</p>
 
    <p>Hear all them politicians squawkin<br>
    Claiming to be the change this country needs<br>
    I get fed up with all that talkin<br>
    And even more fed up with all their doublecrossin low-down deeds<br>
                They say they love you and this country<br>
                All they wanna do is keep it free—<br>
                But they’re only in it for the money <br>
                it’s plain enough to see— </p>
 
    <p>See the preacher in the pulpit<br>
    Quoting scripture at the bored-faced Sunday mass<br>
    Saying “Give, if you can spare it!<br>
    Give all you got and then give that plate a pass—”<br>
                He says a prayer and when he’s done he<br>
                Says, We worship God above all else! <br>
                But ain’t he in it for the money?<br>
                Ain’t he just like everybody else?</p>

    <p>Filled my gastank up with gas—I had to pay the man<br>
    Cop pulled me over for drivin too fast—I had to pay the man<br>
    Pulled up straight to an old toll-gate where a fella held out his hand<br>
    I mistook it, and shook it—and then I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>I ate something that made me sick—I had to pay the man<br>
    I needed medical attention quick—I had to pay the man<br>
    Doctor performed an operation, took out a swollen gland<br>
    He said I’s lucky, he saved my life—and I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>Woe is me is nothing free in this godforsaken land?<br>
                Can’t I even own what’s mine—no ifs buts or ands<br>
                I work all day for a measly pay, I’m so tired I can hardly stand<br>
                As soon as I get off the clock I got to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>I took my girlfriend out to eat—I had to pay the man<br>
    Wanted to use the W.C.—I had to pay the man <br>
    Fella’s in the bathroom givin out towels, sayin they’re to dry my hands<br>
    Then he looks at me expectantly—I had to pay the man </p>
 
    <p>I went to visit mom and dad—I had to pay the man<br>
    Took a bus, a train, and a taxi-cab—I had to pay the man<br>
    When I got home I’s so worked up I shut the door and it slammed<br>
    My father says, “you know the rules,” –and I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I wanted to use a utility—I had to pay the man<br>
    Water, heat, electricity—I had to pay the man<br>
    the furnace popped and the power stopped and the water it froze and jammed<br>
    had to call someone to fix em all—and I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>Well on Sunday I went down to mass—and I had to pay the man<br>
    arrived just in time for the plate to pass—and I had to pay the man<br>
    Father said, “You won’t be judged—just give up what you can,”<br>
    But I swear I couldn’t get out them doors—until after I paid the man</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I expect one night I’ll go and die—and I’ll have to pay the man<br>
    Folks’ll gather round and cry—and I’ll have to pay the man<br>
    Let my epitaph be plain—I don’t want nothing grand<br>
    Let it read: “I’s born, I lived, and I had to pay the man” </p>
 
    <p>Bound or free, alive or dead—I had to pay the man<br>
    Didn’t matter what no one said—I had to pay the man<br>
    Well I wanted to know where my money’s goin—I wanted to understand<br>
    I asked the first person I met—I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>I went ahead and checked my facts—about having to pay the man<br>
    Seems every time I pay a tax—I’m payin uncle Sam<br>
    He spends it so our planes can go drop bombs on a foreign land<br>
    He says I shouldn’t be concerned, it’s all-American </p>
 
    <p>If my money’s gonna fund a war—I ain’t gonna pay the man<br>
    If it’ll get a kid killed on a foreign shore—I ain’t gonna pay the man<br>
    When we got bad schools right here at home, poverty to beat the band<br>
    I’d rather pay a teacher’s salary than to pay that awful man     </p>

    <p>I left my home a young man, sights set on the city<br>
    Aimed to take the first job I could do<br>
    Got hired on the nightshift, paid to drive a forklift<br>
    Had to learn to sleep the whole day through</p>
 
    <p>I met a sweet old lady who owned a small apartment<br>
    Said I could live with her, didn’t that sound great?<br>
    But I didn’t live there cheaply, had to pay bi-weekly<br>
    And she charged me every hour I was late</p>
 
    <p>Neath the risin cost of livin in a world that never pays<br>
                You can get by for a while takin what comes free<br>
                But its trine to make a livin on a no good livin wage<br>
                That’s the only thing that’s killing me</p>
 
    <p>I don’t mind the lack of benefits, the late-long working hours<br>
    Or that they ask me to do overtime each week<br>
    Ain’t like I got a family, or time enough to start one<br>
    Or any living friend of which to speak</p>
 
    <p>but the thing that really gets me, that frustrates and upsets me<br>
    is that I ain’t managed to save even a cent<br>
    cause what don’t go to gas, electric, garbage, fuel, and food<br>
    just goes to payin off my rent</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I’ve heard some folks die of drowning, others of poisoning, electrocution<br>
    some die madly fleeing death’s persistent call<br>
    some die because they’re stranded, heartbroken and abandoned, <br>
    others die for no good reason at all</p>
 
    <p>people die of falling objects, parachutes that didn’t open<br>
    some are murdered, some just die of old age<br>
    but if I live to be 99 I’ll still die of simply trine<br>
    to live on nothing but my living wage</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#roublesAndKopecks_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>They’re building up the city—everybody’s making room<br>
    they’re putting up their signs that say—apartments coming soon!<br>
    All the people who once lived there, who had to sell their properties<br>
    are now gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>the word’s “gentrification”—and you might think it means progress<br>
    and if you’re lookin to move in here, it probably does, I guess<br>
    but if you’ve passed your life here, if you’re someone like me<br>
    you know “gentrification” means “refugee”</p>
 
    <p>Developers are coming in—they’re buying all the land<br>
    They’re building everything brand new, according to their plans<br>
    They talk about creating a strong community<br>
    Without the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>Now you don’t have to move out, the developers all say<br>
    But the rent’s about quadrupled, so you’ll go broke if you stay<br>
    I guess the “neighborhood improvement” don’t apply to me<br>
    I’m a gentrification refugee</p>
 
    <p>My parents lived in this house—since the day that they were wed<br>
    I always thought I’d be here til they carried me out dead<br>
    When the moving truck pulls out of here, let the bumper sticker read:<br>
    Gentrification refugee</p>
 
    <p>They bulldozed the old Woolworth’s—built a high-rise parkinglot<br>
    Tore out the mom and pop place, put in a corporate coffeeshop<br>
    What will mom and pop do in their old age and bankruptcy?<br>
    As new gentrification refugees?</p>
 
    <p>They turned the old cathedral into a climbing gym<br>
    they demolished the old high school, put a strip-mall in <br>
    What they’re going to change next—I won’t be here to see <br>
    I’m a gentrification refugee </p>
 
    <p>Now there’s plenty of things to do here—no, you never will get bored<br>
    Unless the entertainment’s more than you can afford<br>
    If you can’t pay for admission, join the caravan for free<br>
    Of the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>Demographic’s changing, it’s a new population<br>
    Poor blacks is bein swept out—white money’s movin in<br>
    You can draw a hard line tween the new folks of the city <br>
    And the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>They say don’t be nostalgiac—change it can be good<br>
    But there’s nothing familiar about my own neighborhood<br>
    It won’t stay this way for long—that’s a timeless prophesy<br>
    But I’m a gentrification refugee</p>
 
    <p>Where’m I sposed to go now? I haven’t got a home<br>
    Nowhere I can be at rest, no place to call my own<br>
    I guess I’ll hit the highway, long with friends and family<br>
    Join the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>They say not to get angry—the times is all that you can blame<br>
    But I lived here all my life so far, rent’s always been the same<br>
    Somebody must’ve sold out, for a little do-re-me<br>
    Joined the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>It’s happenin in New York and the San Fransisco Bay<br>
    In all the major cities all across the USA<br>
    It’s happening most everywhere I can’t afford to be<br>
    They’re makin gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>You can’t just be a victim, tho I know it’s hard to fathom<br>
    Every place you go now, you’re just adding to the problem<br>
    They say gentrification’s caused by rambling folks like me<br>
    Tho I’m gentrification’s refugee    </p>

    From the bay of fransisco to the new jersey shore<br>
    Just some place to be was all that I’s lookin for<br>
    But I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I did a job for a guy he never paid me for<br>
    I don’t hold it against him tho he promised and swore<br>
    I forgive all my debtors, and I’ll always be poor<br>
    Cause I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I’s down on my luck, I needed help pretty sore<br>
    I’s waiting on aces—and I got handed all four<br>
    I said, “I’m all in,” Dealer said, “Long as you’re sure,”<br>
    And now I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I’m out on the street, it’s a quarter to four<br>
    I been sleeping in front of a mattress store<br>
    A man woke me up said, “You can’t sleep here no more,”<br>
    But I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I done and I thought things that have been less than pure<br>
    So I went down to the church and I pushed on the door<br>
    My hope to replenish and my faith restore<br>
    O but I ain’t got no home in this world anymore </p>
 
    <p>I’ve read terrible things in the family lore<br>
    about my brother, the killer, and my sister, the whore<br>
    but what’s anyone done I could forgive them for<br>
    when I ain’t got no home in this world anymore? </p>
 
    <p>The wind it’ll howl, the rain, it’ll pour<br>
    The blood in your veins fights the cold like a war<br>
    Out on the highway traffic rushes and roars<br>
    O but I ain’t got no home in this world anymore    </p>

    A new pair of shoes and a suit and a wife and three kids and a house and a job<br>
    And when you get tired there’s places to sleep, <br>
    and when you get hungry there’s plenty to eat<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend do you know, how to get to Easy Street?</p>
 
    <p>I heard there’s a man there, he’s a doctor of sorts, he can cure almost any disease<br>
    Ailments, addictions, afflictions and worse—all you gotta do is say please<br>
    He won’t charge you nothing, he works pretty cheap; <br>
    when he gives you his promise, you know it’ll keep<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say friend do you know, how to get to Easy Street?<br>
                Easy Street—where the livin is easy<br>

    If anyone sees you hangin around, they’ll tell you to just come on inside<br>
    They won’t ask where you been on your runaway streak; <br>
    if the cops come around, they won’t make a peep<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend, do you know, how to get to Easy Street?</p>
 
    <p>I heard that they’ve got more than enough to go round, they won’t make you stand in no lines<br>
    You can stand where you like and come as you are, there ain’t no “No Trespassin” signs<br>
    There’s no trials or contests in which to compete<br>
    There ain’t any forms that you’ll need to complete<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend, do you know—how to get to easy street?<br>
                Chorus</p>
 
    <p>I met a young man who knew the place well, he smiled, remembering it<br>
    I asked, “Can I go?” he shook his head no, said, “you haveta be born into it—<br>
    “And if you ever get out by making the leap—you’ll never get back in, the climb is too steep—<br>
    “I’m sorry to say but there’s no other way for to get to easy street.”</p>
 
    <p>I met another man claimed he came from that place, said he’s born there in some ancient year<br>
    I asked him the way and all he could say was, “Friend—you can’t get there from here,<br>
    “So if you get beaten, just turn your cheek—what you sew in joy in sorrow you’ll reap<br>
    “I’m sorry to say but there’s no other way for to get to easy street.”<br>
                Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Have you heard of this place you can make up a dream and pursue it until it comes true?<br>
    Where whatever you’ve done and where ever you’re from cant in anyway be held against you?<br>
    is there anywhere I can kick up my feet? Or get out of this rain and this godawful heat?<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend, do you know how to get to easy street?     </p>

    <p>Another young black man is dead<br>
    before the age of twenty-one<br>
    Shot to death by an officer <br>
    who claimed he thought he had a gun<br>
    They’re talking bout it on the radio<br>
    There’s footage on the nightly news<br>
    Just can’t seem to get away<br>
    From the police brutality blues</p>
 
    <p>The cops are dressed in riot gear<br>
    they say my neighborhood’s secure<br>
    I used to think they were protectin me, <br>
    now they’re just wagin war<br>
                the officers are trained to kill <br>
                self-defense is their excuse     <br>
                the whole nation’s coming down with<br>
                the police brutality blues </p>
 
    <p>If a black man kills a cop<br>
    Someone will see that he will swing<br>
    If a cop kills a black-skinned kid <br>
    It doesn’t mean a goddam thing<br>
    Nevermind that he was unarmed<br>
                the ruling somehow always proves<br>
    Courts still haven’t found a cure <br>
    For the police brutality blues</p>
 
    <p>Now we’re a civilized society<br>
    That we need laws, I can understand<br>
    That don’t explain why it takes six white cops<br>
    To write a ticket to one black man<br>
                It don’t explain why he must get out <br>
                Or why he’s guilty if he refuse<br>
                It don’t explain why so many got<br>
                The police brutality blues </p>
 
    <p>A mother lays her child to rest<br>
    She’s been stricken dumb<br>
    The unarmed man they shot to death<br>
    Was a husband, a father, a son<br>
                There’s a baby in his mother’s arms<br>
                too young to know the truth <br>
                That his father had a fatal case of<br>
                the police brutality blues    </p>

    <p>I’s down and out—couldn’t find a job<br>
    Door of opportunity had a broken knob<br>
    And I don’t mind that I should have to knock<br>
    But that the line to get there goes down and around the block<br>
                You just stand there and never move<br>
                with them unemployment blues <br>
                Til the police come and you’re kicked to the curb—</p>
 
    <p>Well you want to run, and they’ll see that you crawl<br>
    You try climb and they’ll just help you fall<br>
    no way to carry what you’re made to haul<br>
    Gotta live your life with your back up against a wall<br>
                Like a turtle on its back—<br>
                In the noose and losing slack—<br>
                So that you’re never more than one step from the verge—  </p>
 
    <p>CHORUS tell me—whose hand do I have to shake?<br>
                            How long do I have to wait?
                            Do I gotta hurt somebody? What’ll it take?
                            Fore I can start to expect, and begin to collect—on a little of the respect                 
                                                                                                                I deserve?
    <p>I survived on my own little bit<br>
    I worked and sang and then I begged for it<br>
    Staying hungry’s how I kept so fit<br>
    you can’t get too far when you’re far gone in the pit—<br>
                it’s designed to keep you down<br>
                try to surface and you’ll drown<br>
                til your prison and your freedom’s gotten blurred—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Wish I could payback all that I’ve been lent<br>
    Save a little more than a half-a-cent<br>
    Earn enough to leave my tenement<br>
    But as it is, I can’t afford to pay the rent—<br>
                And the gas has been shut off<br>
                And I’ve come down with a cough—<br>
                and the debt collector’s getting on my nerves—</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Used to be young but now I’m getting old<br>
    They’ve gotten rid of all that hasn’t sold<br>
    After years of trying, I still can’t fit the mold<br>
    Can’t seem to learn to do just what I’m told<br>
                I always gotta know what for<br>
                And even then I still ain’t sure<br>
                Authority will say: it ain’t like you heard—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>times is hard—and they’re a’getting worse<br>
    all you can pass on is an empty purse<br>
    seems everybody’s got a grudge to nurse<br>
    against themselves, each other, or the entire universe<br>
                its everybody for himself<br>
                nobody stops to lend you help<br>
                unless it’s to teach you some unfriendly word </p>

    <p>I get up in the morning when I still can’t see the light<br>
    Work without a pause or break til you can’t see again at night<br>
    Your skin turns all to leather as your hands get hurt and sore<br>
    All the while you’re wonderin: What am I even working for?<br>
                My house is just a plywood shed; my kids is barely clothed<br>
                I’m a getting on in years, how long I got, who knows?<br>
                Money in my pocket it was bought with my blood and sweat<br>
                And as long as there is work to do we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>God made the world in seven days, so the story goes<br>
    What he’s been doin ever since, there ain’t a soul who knows<br>
    He made some strange creations but the one that’s most worth seein<br>
    Is the curious experiment he called the human being<br>
                Here’s a creature, goes around looking a’low and high<br>
                For something to surrender to, to make him happy ‘fore he dies<br>
                The unvarying response to any answer it can get<br>
                Is: so long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>The earth it is a dyin off—we’ve wrecked it pretty fair<br>
    Tore down every rainforest and polluted all the air<br>
    Melted all the ice-caps and filled up the sea with trash<br>
    I don’t want to be a downer, but I don’t think it’s a gonna last<br>
                You may be a composter and recycle all your wares<br>
                You spent your life campaigning for cleaner, healthier air<br>
                You think your carbon footprint’s about as small as it can get—<br>
                But as long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>Now I come from a country, USA’s the name<br>
    Sometimes it’s a point of pride, but it’s often one of shame<br>
    The leaders in my country practice hate and bigotry<br>
    And I don’t want my representatives representing me<br>
                Our prisons are exploding and our schools is getting worse<br>
                Our healthcare system cannot seem to Put the People First<br>
                As far as the reversal goes—there’s been some progress, I’ll admit,<br>
                But so long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>So you’ve marched against the big machine and perhaps you won the day<br>
    Your cry for justice has been heard, and for once, things went your way<br>
    It took bout everything you had, but you came out on top<br>
    but it’ll all disintegrate again the moment that you stop— <br>
                So I’m gonna keep marchin, I ain’t lookin back<br>
                Ain’t gonna let my guard down or give out any slack <br>
                When I’m dead and in my grave that’s when I’m a gonna quit<br>
                But as long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet    </p>

    <p>He arrived in town on this morning’s train<br>
    Nevermind his business, nevermind his name<br>
    Came seekin shelter from a pourin rain<br>
    And to quench a thirst he’d probably had too long</p>
 
    <p>He stepped into a cheap hotel<br>
    Dipped the feather quill in the old ink well<br>
    Signed his name as William tell<br>
    The owner asked, “Will you be staying long?”</p>
 
    <p>Just passin through, just passin through<br>
        Didn’t come for no appointment, nor no rendezvous<br>
        Passin through, I’m just passin through<br>
        To stay for just a night, or maybe two—either way I’m only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>He had no luggage of which to speak<br>
    Just a long dark scar runnin down his cheek<br>
    Eyes that would’ve made a strong woman week<br>
    That seemed to know the truth and seek it out</p>
 
    <p>Hotel owner’s daughter, miss Eleanor<br>
    Caught sight of th stranger comin in the door<br>
    Saw that he lodged in room number four<br>
    And then she went and asked her father who he was</p>
 
    <p>He’s just passin through, just passin through<br>
        I’d leave him be, and so should you<br>
        He’s passin through, just passin through<br>
        He didn’t come to fall in love with you—leave him be, he’s only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>But her father’s warning she did not heed<br>
    She stole into his room in her stocking feet<br>
    Knocked and entered and turned the key<br>
    And by morningtime, she still had not emerged</p>
 
    <p>“O, Mr. Tell, won’t you tell me please<br>
    Is it your intention now to marry me?<br>
    Or do you still mean to up and leave?<br>
    Like you told my father that you would?”</p>
 
    <p>I’m just passin through, just passing through<br>
        Didn’t come to settle, just to see the view<br>
        Passin through, I’m just passin through<br>
        Would’ve told you but I really thought you knew—darlin, I was only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>Says Ms. Eleanor—“Well in that case,<br>
    Never again may I show my face<br>
    I will tell my father I have been disgraced, <br>
    And he will probably try to shoot you down,”</p>
 
    <p>And before ms. Eleanor’s speech was done,<br>
    In comes her father with a big shotgun<br>
    Says to Mr. Tell, “Won’t you tell me son,<br>
    Just what it is you think that you are doin?”</p>
 
    <p>I’m just passin through, just passin through<br>
        Now that I’ve stayed I best be getting to<br>
        Passin through, just passin through<br>
        Didn’t come to quarrel with the likes of you—you know I was only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>“Well not so fast,” the hotel owner said<br>
    “Either you’ll marry sweet ellie here, or else you’ll be dead!”<br>
    And he aimed that gun at poor william’s head<br>
    Said, “Tell me, tell, what’s it gonna be?”</p>
 
    <p>To William’s defense, Eleanor leapt to<br>
    The father panicked, shot poor willy through<br>
    and as the daughter cried, “what did you do?”<br>
    William tell, he spoke these final words:</p>
 
    <p>Passin through, just passin through<br>
        Life sure ain’t long and there ain’t much to do<br>
        The pains are many and the pleasure’s few<br>
        I’ll die now, but someday so will you—all of us, we’re only passin through</p>
 
    <p>Passin through, just passin through<br>
        With time enough to say hello, adieu<br>
        Passin through, just passin through<br>
        Just like every single breath you drew—All of us—we’re only passin through     </p>

    <p>Yesterday the well dried up and the drought has just begun<br>
    We never prayed for more than just a little more than none<br>
    Fella from the bank dropped by with a mortgage and a deed<br>
    Said I could either sign them or he’d sign them both for me<br>
    Said he knew my troubles, knew my work, my pain, my need<br>
    Couldn’t tell if he was talking out of duty or just greed</p>
 
    <p>Ma and pa were farmers and they died relatively young<br>
    Thank god they didn’t live to see what their children would become<br>
    Cassius makes his livin givin hungry folks the heave<br>
    Gets the D.A. to arrest the ones he cannot get to leave<br>
    Now he carries round his rifle drinking whiskey from a sleeve<br>
    And he’s still as poor as they are, and well, as for me</p>
 
    <p>I’m just gonna wait here on this land I used to own<br>
        Til the houses fall to ruin and the pastures have regrown<br>
        Til the countryside is silenced as the gears of progress moan<br>
        Til over my dead body the winds of change have blown<br>
        til I’m nothing but a worn out washed up stack of farmer’s bones<br>
        I’m just gonna wait here til my cows come home</p>
 
    <p>Guess I’m just too sad to laugh, and still too proud to cry<br>
    Too old to learn, too poor to move, too young to die<br>
    Ma always said I always was as stubborn as the mule<br>
    Just like my paw who had the reputation for the fool<br>
    Who always said you won’t find education in a school<br>
    Nor kindness in a good deed, nor the just life in the rule</p>
 
    <p>All the weeds have gone to seed, and the barns in disrepair<br>
    Nothing left to sell at market and no livestock for the fair<br>
    Sold the silo and the greenhouse, the tractor and the plow<br>
    Sold the chickens and the henhouse, the horses and the cows<br>
    Sold it all believing we would get it back somehow<br>
    And the newsreporter wants to know just what will we do now?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>They say history repeats itself, there’s a time for everything<br>
    A time to reap to sew to live to die to mourn to sing<br>
    They’ll tell you to be quiet as though your breathin were a waste<br>
    They’ll tell you to look here now, as though the music could be faced<br>
    They’ll tell you that it’s over, as though your dreams could be erased<br>
    Make sure your dreams are big enough you don’t lose them in the chase</p>
 
    <p>Mattie says she’s got a family waiting way out in the west<br>
    And not too much to carry she can hitch a ride I guess<br>
    Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a flour-sack<br>
    They been gone three weeks now, and probably won’t come back<br>
    Last I saw of john-boy he was headed for the tracks<br>
    With nothing but a canteen and the clothes upon his back<br>
    Maybe someday I will follow, if I can ever get the knack<br>
    Til then</p>

    <h2>The Bargain</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Unravelled Tales - Volume 1, 2021</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales1_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>One day, long ago at the oaks of Mamre God upon Abraham called<br>
    To splain the haviors of his fellow man and tell him why man is worth saving:</p>
 
    <p>“Hey man, Abraham, where have you been? Through all creation I been searchin for ya<br>
    To tell you I’m gwin in one day’s time to destroy Sodom and Gamorrah”</p>
 
    <p>Abe said, “Hey there God, you sure got me thinking a lot and I think I got a proposition for ya<br>
    Say there’s sixty-two men in those cities of sin<br>
    With no idea of the bad shape they’re in<br>
    And no one to tell them how it’s all gonna end<br>
    And no chance to change if there’s no change to send<br>
    If I should show you sixty-two righteous men<br>
    Then would you save us in Sodom and Gamorrah?”</p>
 
    <p>Well God put his finger up to his chin, he said, “Abe, you ain’t trine to bargain are ya?<br>
    I am The Lord, almighty and vain, and I made thee and I can destroy ya,”</p>
 
    <p>Abe said, “Not so hot, now you got me on the spot, and if you’ll let me I’ve got an answer for ya<br>
    An injustice it seems that for a percentage share<br>
    You would presume to know every single person there<br>
    From the language in his teeth to the color of his hair<br>
    From his midnight grin to his twilight stare<br>
    Say, if this is how you judge then what do you even care<br>
    Who lives or dies in Sodom and Gamorrah?”</p>
 
    <p>God said, “Alright, I am not gonna fight—go, you gotcher self till tumarrya<br>
    To find sixty-two men of the righteousest of ken, to spare you in Sodom and Gamorrah.”</p>
 
    <p>Well, then Abraham thought, “Well, sixty-two sure seems a lot<br>
    For forty would the bargain still stand for ya?”<br>
    God willingly agreed he said, “If forty’s all you need,<br>
    Then it’s forty, and I’ll see you tumarrya.”</p>
 
    <p>As God turned to go, Abe shouted from below, “Wait a minute, you’re not finished talkin are ya?<br>
    If forty’s understood then wouldn’t twenty be just as good<br>
    And would twenty satisfy any better than twelve would?<br>
    And would you take even a dozen of the best men if you could?<br>
    And even if you could, you should ask whether you should<br>
    When what makes a righteous man is but barely understood<br>
    On penalty of contract, autographed in blood<br>
    Imposed upon a people you once washed out with a flood<br>
    Is it really any wonder we don’t behave as we should<br>
    But go ahead and tell me, and please, be honest if you would, <br>
    cause I got pity for Sodom and Gamorrah.”</p>
 
    <p>God said, “Abe, I’m amazed in this game you wanna play,<br>
    Is it really all that important for ya?<br>
    Very well, let’s be plain, find me even one good name, <br>
    And I’ll spare your precious Sodom and Gamorrah.”</p>
 
    <p>Well the evening came and went, soon Abe’s time was nearly spent<br>
    To Mamre went Abraham on the morrow<br>
    And God laughed when he saw the lonesome tired Abraham<br>
    And he said, “Poor Abe, you’re not really surprised now, are ya?”</p>
 
    <p>Abe said, “You earn your love through fear<br>
    I earn mine through love<br>
    Tho you may be omniscient, omnipresent and all that,<br>
    You don’t know what it’s like to live down here.”     </p>

    <p>I’ve been trying to remember the way this story starts<br>
    That increases in confusion, goes off the rails in parts,<br>
    That catalogues the romance of an idiot savant<br>
    Who never can quite manage to decide what it is he wants…<br>
    And goes on to lend the details of secret that was kept<br>
    So well that all the pieces fail to meaningfully connect…<br>
    Who placed her on a pedestal which he named his Stumblingblock<br>
    And was the only souvenir he had when he became the laughingstock…</p>
 
    <p>There’s a sign-post lost in ivy at the old fork in the road<br>
    One arrow points to nowhere, the other towards the motherload<br>
    But the traveler’s in a snowdrift, and he hasn’t yet found out<br>
    That the footprints he’s been following are his own, without a doubt<br>
    And the carriage-driver’s mumbling, he’s been known for nodding off<br>
    I heard he killed a man once who accused him of being lost<br>
    but the circle’s ever-widening, every revolution grows <br>
    the time it takes for one to realize what everyone already knows…</p>
 
    <p>And still I feel the strange sensation that I’ve had this dream before<br>
    because I’m not participating, I’m just the one who’s keeping score<br>
    the cups were filled with coffee by the waitress with the pin<br>
    who poisons her own lipstick and leaves it showing on the brim<br>
    The hallway chatterboxes are all waiting to descend<br>
    Upon a service elevator that cannot rise as high as them<br>
    The fire on the mountain has gotten kind out of hand<br>
    There’s no method to distinguish between the innocent and damned—</p>
 
    <p>The clock’s a double-crosser—else how’d the hour get so late?<br>
    And what happened to the lobster that was just resting on my plate?<br>
    I didn’t mean to interrupt you—we were somewhere in the meal<br>
    Either I was asking you, or you were wondering how I feel—<br>
    The bartender looks impatient for the commercials to resume<br>
    In the backyard a slumped hound-dog being howled at by a moon<br>
    beneath the porter’s window the station’s leaving from the train<br>
    I guess I’m a little empty, kinda lost and scatterbrained…</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been to see the barber at the dark end of the cave<br>
    You can tell when he’s been drinking by the closeness of his shave<br>
    There’s a headstone in the parlor, it’s been leaning gainst the stairs<br>
    I’m afraid I’ll turn it over and find my own name written there<br>
    I climbed up on my ladder for to call on you again<br>
    But the candle’s always burning in the room you’re never in<br>
    Have you ever been so lonely that you shattered into song<br>
    And felt you’d found a place at last where you could just belong?    </p>

    <p>Well everybody’s got a thing to say about the girl there dancing across the way<br>
    How her hair flows and her hips, they sway—all night long<br>
    Where she comes from and who she is, how she got into a place like this,<br>
    These are all things that these watchers wish they knew for sure<br>
    Some say that she’s a queen from a country somewhere that no one’s seen<br>
    Where everything that you hope and dream, it just comes true</p>
 
    <p>Where they go: Sha la la la la la la Sha la la la la la la<br>
                Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la</p>
 
    <p>Some say that she’s a married girl who’s traveled half way around the world<br>
    Searching for her precious pearl, a man she loves<br>
    Some say that she’s a widowed wife, that she’s been dancing here all her life<br>
    Mourning morning noon and night a man she loves<br>
    Nobody seems to know her name, or speak her language or play her game<br>
    But every evening, moon stars or rain, she dances here<br>
    She wears what I wouldn’t quite call a smile, opens her eyes every once in a while<br>
    She’s dangerous and versatile, she seems to say<br>
    With her there its hard to concentrate, everything else feels second rate<br>
    Mostly folks they just speculate as they stand in awe<br>
    They wonder does she even know that she’s the reason for the crowded show<br>
    That she’s the reason that the music’s slow and the hour’s late<br>
    To have danced with her none can boast, won’t let nobody get too close<br>
    Some people say that she’s just a ghost, that she ain’t there<br>
    She don’t like licorice, only caramel; don’t like dresses but she wears them well<br>
    You’ve never met her but she rings a bell inside of you<br>
    She keeps her balance with an expert skill, looks like she’s dancing when she’s standin still<br>
    You can’t tell if it’s love until she tries to go<br>
    And every evening when the music’s done and the bar is closing for the morning sun<br>
    There’s no one left, she’s the only one who’s dancing still<br>
    She has this way where she leaves a room smelling strongly of her sweet perfume<br>
    Humming softly a spanish tune as her footsteps fade<br>
    And all the boys come and gather round and try to recognize the sound<br>
    Declare the dance floor to be hallowed ground as she slips away</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>

    <p>a gambler’s a man / who knows that a plan’s / just a story that’s spun out of dreams<br>
    it can act as a prop / to get you to stop / but temporary is all that it means<br>
    sooner than not / you’ll get what you’ve bought / whether you lose or you win<br>
    I’ve lost my share / but look, I’m still here / so, dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>I seen all kinds / from the ones who read minds / to them who can’t spot a tell from a bluff<br>
    To the burn-outs, retired / hard-lucks, hardwired / who can’t say when they’ve had enough<br>
    I’ve heard the advice / of them who say to think twice / what do they know about where I been?<br>
    If you had these blues / I’ll wager you, too / ‘d be sayin: Dealer, deal me again</p>
 
    <p>I had me a girl / she was out of this world / she was a once-in-a-lifetime affair<br>
    I asked her to stay / she told me o.k. / then she high-tailed it right out of there<br>
    I heard through the mill / she’s been up to it still / making fools out of dangerous men<br>
    Still causin a stir / Ain’t that good for her? / Dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>Some play for the thrill / for the hunt or the kill / for the chance to be something they’re not<br>
    Some play cause they know / just how it will go / so long as they never get caught<br>
    Me, I’m the sort / who lives for the sport / I play for sheer love of the game<br>
    Don’t matter what / poker straight, draw or stud / Dealer, just deal me again</p>
 
    <p>When it was you / I did what I could do / to let you know I was your friend<br>
    I held you aside / to defend you, I lied / and if I had to, I’d do it again<br>
    But now it’s reversed / and I come to you first / you act like you don’t know who I am—<br>
    If I’m still in the game / and the rules haven’t changed / well dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>You tried to live straight / as something you hate / and you know that it won’t ever fit<br>
    It’s a gamble as soon / as you’re torn from the womb / til you finally cash in your chips<br>
    To live is to bet / in a game against Death / and you know the house wins in the end<br>
    But if it’s all gone to hell / spose I might as well… / Dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>I’m friends with the bar / doorman’s got a car / there’d be more than enough to go round<br>
    a few guns, for show / and a place to lay low / where we could wait for the heat to die down<br>
    maybe it’s how you feel / or it’s there in the deal / or it’s some kind of wheel you just spin<br>
    you won’t know til it lands / or you’ve played out your hand / Dealer, won’t you deal me again?    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales1_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I went down to the poolhall / late on a Tuesday<br>
    nothing but a dollar to my name<br>
    I was only looking / to pass some hours<br>
    While I waited for my leven o’clock train</p>
 
    <p>Well I took a seat at / an empty table<br>
    It couldn’t have been no later than quarter past<br>
    There were a few games going / not a whole lot happenin<br>
    I wondered how long my dollar was gonna last</p>
 
    <p>Among the poolsharks / and grizzly fellas<br>
    I saw two hustlers taking money left and right<br>
    They were shooting doubles / telling stories<br>
    Of how this must’ve been their lucky night</p>
 
    <p>Well I got distracted / by a well-known waitress<br>
    Named Rita, wearing stockings and a fishnet blouse <br>
    She said, “You thirsty” / I said, “I got no money,”<br>
    She said, “It won’t help you—this ones on the house.”</p>
 
    <p>Well she brought me something / it was all a bubblin<br>
    I sniffed it, then I took a thirsty pull<br>
    When I brought the cup down / everyone was starin<br>
    Somebody whispered, “That man done lost his soul.”</p>
 
    <p>Well I started feeling / a little funny<br>
    And then I blacked out and fell right to the floor<br>
    When I came to / the place had cleared out<br>
    Cept for one of those two hustlers from before</p>
 
    <p>He put his hand out / said “Pleased to know you,”<br>
    I can see you’re new here, so allow me to explain:<br>
    Said, “You’re dead now / but this ain’t heaven<br>
    That there’s Rita—and Satan is my name.” </p>
 
    <p>He said, “I see your startled / that’s only natural<br>
    good news is that I’m a gambling man<br>
    if you play me / in a game of billiards<br>
    I’ll let you have your soul back, if you win.”</p>
 
    <p>Well I accepted his conditions<br>
    In my position, hell, what else could I do?<br>
    He racked the balls up, rearranged em <br>
    and then broke em while I eyed and chalked my cue</p>
 
    <p>Well the break was perfect / he made six balls in<br>
    every pocket on the table took a hit<br>
    Three were striped ones / and three were solid <br>
    Satan said, “I guess I get my pick.”</p>
 
    <p>He chose solids / and eyed the two-ball<br>
    Said, “Corner pocket,” and gave an awful grin<br>
    It looked unlikely / downright impossible<br>
    Sent the cue-ball round the table and Number 2 went in</p>
 
    <p>Then he said “Watch this,” / said, “You see that pair there?”<br>
    He pointed at the 1 up against the 3<br>
    He hit the cue ball / smack in between em<br>
    And each went in different holes, simultaneously</p>
 
    <p>Well I’s in trouble / and boy, I knew it<br>
    But I held my piece and didn’t let nothing show<br>
    He had a clean shot / on the number 7<br>
    And, of course, he made it, with just the 8 ball left to go</p>
 
    <p>When all of a sudden, he became curious<br>
    Said, “I hate to win so easy with the stakes so high”<br>
    He fired gently, grazed the eight-ball <br>
    Said, “If you think you can win, let’s see you try!” </p>
 
    <p>Well just then something made me look at Rita<br>
    she looked so lonesome, so lovely and so sad <br>
    I said to Satan, “Before I shoot here,<br>
    What do you say we revise the agreement that we had?” </p>
 
    <p>I said, “If I’m defeated, you get my spirit<br>
    It’ll be all yours to do with what you feel—<br>
    But if I win, you free Rita—”<br>
    Satan laughed and said, “That’s all? You gotta deal.”</p>
 
    <p>I said, “For a hustler, you know you’re pretty cocky<br>
    I’m surprised to know the devil even gives a damn—<br>
    I didn’t want to / haveta hurt your feelings—<br>
    but you must have no idea who I am”</p>
 
    <p>And saying that much / I took my first shot<br>
    Hit the nine into the ten into the twelve<br>
    Sunk em easy / and went on shooting<br>
    Til I cleared that entire table by myself</p>
 
    <p>When it was over / I put my hand out<br>
    Said, “I’ll be taking back our souls, now, I trust<br>
    He said “That wasn’t our agreement—”<br>
    I said “Actually, as a matter of fact, it was—” </p>
 
    <p>I explained that long time before this<br>
    Rita’s and my soul were intertwined, <br>
    “Techically speaking, I belong to her—<br>
    I’m as much a part of hers as she is of mine.”</p>
 
    <p>Sometimes folks ask me how I met Rita<br>
    How we ever came to be husband and wife<br>
    I always tell em it’s a boring story:<br>
    One time she tried to kill me, and saved my life.    </p>

    <p>There was a time when what was yours was mine—and vice versa<br>
    If I’m not on cue, I’d be more’n glad to reimburse ya<br>
    I spose it’s a flaw to believe in the law of inertia<br>
    That says what is will be—I say let’s wait and see:</p>
 
    <p>We been through our share of trial and error and judgment<br>
    Enduring the eyes of society wives and their husbands<br>
    We’ve paid all their dues and even a few of their “doesn’t”s<br>
    it’s come down to this—still, somethings amiss<br>
        I know it ain’t my place<br>
        to tell you where and when you seem a little off-base<br>
        But in this case I’d embrace<br>
        my own share of the blame— </p>
 
    <p>For your own good, for your own health<br>
        I wish you’d hold up a mirror and look at yourself<br>
    When it’s so obvious to everyone else <br>
        That you ain’t the same—<br>
    That you’re different now, there’s something new, something I can’t name<br>
    I can’t quite put my finger on it, I can’t quite explain<br>
        you’ve changed </p>
 
    <p>The thieves in the yard check to see that the guard is still dozing<br>
    the hostess distressed, accuses her guests of imposing<br>
    The butterfly sleeps while its body keeps metamorphosing<br>
    The caterpillar cocooned—I’m damned or I’m doomed</p>
 
    <p>reviewing a list of items you wished to be handed<br>
    I saw at a glance that romance had been taken for granted <br>
    I’d’ve pointed it out except doubt had me thoroughly stranded<br>
    Nowhere to go—except on with the show<br>
        I feel so at a loss<br>
        Like a freewheeling boulder trying to gather its moss<br>
        Just tell me what it will cost<br>
        And what I stand to gain—</p>
 
    <p>And in the meantime, I’ll concede<br>
        That in what I’ve undertaken I will never succeed<br>
        nor surrender, nor give in, nor need<br>
            long as you’re in the frame—<br>
        I’m not going to mince words, I’ll stand by my claim<br>
        There’s just something about you, doesn’t go with the grain—<br>
        you’ve changed</p>
 
    <p>Down in the vault the cult meeting’s called into order<br>
    A man with no voice makes a choice by flipping a quarter<br>
    Someone disagrees and is made to eat cheese in the corner<br>
    Reciting the laws—neath the sound of applause</p>
 
    <p>Prometheus spits even though he’s been gifted with forethought<br>
    He lays down his check and places his bet on the longshot<br>
    He thinks of his life, of his kids and his wife and the onslaught<br>
    Of debts he can’t drown—maybe it’ll all turn around <br>
    Look out there, on the tide<br>
        Ain’t the grass always greener on the sea’s other side?<br>
        But to get there don’t you gotta ride<br>
        Through a horizon of flames— </p>
 
    <p>And as your dreams slowly break apart<br>
        And every time you look back you find you’re still at the start <br>
        you don’t see it, but you know, somehow, down in your heart <br>
            that you ain’t quite the same—<br>
    something’s different now, something new you can’t quite explain—<br>
    in spite of yourself, of your goals, and your aims<br>
    you’ve changed</p>
 
    <p>Honey I’ve tried all these rules to abide, but I’m failing<br>
    I was hoping to skip getting stuck on this ship but it’s sailing<br>
    If it springs a leak I’ll be tempted to leap—oer the railing<br>
    swim for the shore—til I can’t swim anymore—</p>
 
    <p>Coyotes dance while the wind in the branch is still blowing<br>
    Out in the fields the summertime yields unto snowing<br>
    Don’t know what I’ll find but I’ve made up my mind and I’m going<br>
    On up ahead—just like I said<br>
        don’t feed me that old blue line<br>
        If I have a say in the matter there won’t be a next time <br>
        I know maybe you don’t mind—<br>
            But I won’t stand for the pain</p>
 
    <p>You didn’t see me see you blush<br>
        But you gotta lay down your cards when they’re callin your bluff<br>
        And God help you if you don’t have the stuff<br>
            to go on or maintain<br>
        you gotta play by the dealer’s rules or get out of the game<br>
        if you don’t know it by now, you will when you set foot on that train— <br>
        you’ve changed     </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales1_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>As I was riding down the road / of a country strange, homeward bound<br>
    A gust of wind rose from the east / and knocked me sprawling to the ground<br>
    My horse, tho startled, didn’t fall / he only reared and neighed and fled<br>
    I called his name but he’d gone too far / I was stranded, helpless, left for dead</p>
 
    <p>In the muddied ditch I lay awhile / from consciousness I came and went<br>
    Until I startled at the sound / of a drunken carriageman’s lament<br>
    He’d only stopped to rest his horse / and permit an overdue relief<br>
    I scared him nearly half to death / when I begged for him to “Help me—please!”</p>
 
    <p>He hoisted me into his ride / two passengers already were aboard<br>
    a prospector heading for his mine, and a Lady going to meet her Lord<br>
    they took me in and nursed my wounds / from a scarf the Lady fashioned me a sling<br>
    they asked to know from whence I came / but I couldn’t remember anything</p>
 
    <p>we drove all night until the dawn / by sun-up we had made the town<br>
    the driver stopped at the Blue Hotel / told the concierge to bring the doctor down<br>
    the doctor was a shiftless man / he smelled of whiskey something fierce<br>
    his arms were bare but for tattoos / his ears and lips and nose were pierced</p>
 
    <p>he carried me up to his room and gave me something for the pain<br>
    I passed out almost immediately / when I awoke, we were on the move again<br>
    This time it was a different scene / I’s in a box-car bound and gagged<br>
    The conductor, through his surgeon’s mask, / gave me a morsel and said it was all he had</p>
 
    <p>At the station we were shuffled off / some people had already died<br>
    Another carriage found me there / I’s ordered to “Hurry! Get inside!”<br>
    I was taken to a large estate / where I served a man of much esteem<br>
    Eventually I earned his trust / and learned to interpret all his dreams</p>
 
    <p>He found my skills so excellent, he decided I should meet the king<br>
    And when the king looked on my face, he burst into tears, remembering<br>
    He said I was his long-lost son, finally at last come home again <br>
    He said, My horse arrived years before—they figured I’d been robbed and slain!</p>
 
    <p>He stripped my siblings of their rites, their inheritance to me conferred<br>
    Introduced me to my fiancé; that same night I married her<br>
    At dawn I rose to walk the grounds and see what memories I could wake<br>
    I found the gardener in his grove, he said I’d made a grave mistake</p>
 
    <p>He said my wife’d forsaken me, and had become his lover since<br>
    he told me that she loved him still, but of that I remained unconvinced<br>
    he challenged me unto a duel and offered me a loaded gun<br>
    we took ten paces from ourselves, turned and fired—he lost, I won</p>
 
    <p>the gunshot roused a sleeping guard / who arrived in time to see the death<br>
    the gardener laid the blame on me / with his dying final breath— <br>
    I fled to my old and ragged horse, a beast unfit to bear a prince— <br>
    a gust of wind rose from the east, which I’ve been chasing ever since…    </p>

    <p>I come from a place somewheres in the East<br>
    But I had to get away and hide<br>
    I set out for the West, and every place I think to rest<br>
    I just get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    I just get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>I always hoped to live with good, upstanding folks<br>
    But their customs I could not abide<br>
    Before I’d push a broom, I’d be ready just as soon<br>
    To get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    Get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>When I asked for advice on how to live a moral life<br>
    They told me: let my conscience be my guide<br>
    Whenever trouble comes, I’m either reaching for my gun<br>
    Else I get back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    Get back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I came into a town where a crowd had gathered round<br>
    A wanted poster that said “Dead or Alive!”<br>
    Well anybody there could see the fella looked a lot like me<br>
    So I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I rode into a town that was crawling with police<br>
    They’s in every place I looked inside<br>
    Rather than try my luck, riskin getting stuck,<br>
    I just got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I just got back on my horse to ride </p>
 
    <p>I rode into a place just as a church was letting out<br>
    To the priest I went in to confide<br>
    “My son you cannot win,” he said, “Turn your poor self in!”<br>
    So I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I’ve tried out all the sins that can damn a man to hell<br>
    And the worst of all the sins is pride<br>
    If I’m bound for hell, I suppose I might as well<br>
    Just get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    I just get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>I came upon a man who was hanging on a cross<br>
    A sharpened spear had pierced his side<br>
    There was no one else around, so I cut that fellow down<br>
    Then I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    Got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I come into a bar where some men was playing cards<br>
    “You in?” they asked, “I’m in,” I replied<br>
    Fore they knew what I’s about, I cleaned them fellas out<br>
    Then I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I once knew a man who lived on others’ trust<br>
    Borrowed from far and wide<br>
    “What you gonna do when your first payment is due?”<br>
    Gonna get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    Gonna get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>They say that only love can break your heart<br>
    And know it’s true, cause I tried <br>
    But when you feel it’s through, the only thing to do<br>
    Is to get back on that horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    Is get back on that horse and ride    </p>

    <p>Went to see my doctor and he’s looking at my file<br>
“Your vaccines have expired, friend,” he tells me with a smirk<br>
He asks me, “How long’s it been?” I say, “I guess it’s been a while,”<br>
Then he tells me he’ll be right back—“why don’t you go remove your shirt?”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
As I ever was, as I’ll ever get<br>
I’m ready now as I’ll ever hope to ever be again<br>
Good or bad or just okay<br>
I’m ready for it either way<br>
So come on—hurry up—alright already—give it to me, then! </p>
 
    <p>Rose was in her senior year when I started at her school<br>
Her boyfriend, Joe, was captain of two athletic teams <br>
She was nothing like me, she was popular and cool— <br>
the most beautiful woman my young eyes had ever seen</p>
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I took my darling out to eat the evening before last<br>
To celebrate our five year dating anniversary<br>
I was wondering how her day went and was just about to ask<br>
When she said, “If you’re going to propose, you’d better get down on one knee,” </p>
 
    <p>And told her so, at which point she excused herself to cry—<br>
While she was gone the waitress slipped me her old wedding-band<br>
Said, “I don’t need this anymore, why don’t you give it a try?”</p>
 
 
 
 
    <p>The night before our wedding my fiancé and I<br>
Got into a fight so bad we thought the plug was pulled<br>
She left the rehearsal without so much as goodbye<br>
I thought it just as well—my feet were getting plenty cold</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>Well I came into some money so I thought of buying up a home<br>
Scoured the whole city, found one place I could afford<br>
I put the offer in soon as the bank approved my loan<br>
But the owner’d already promised it to some millionaire landlord</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>Well I went to see an old friend on the night before he died<br>
He’d been diagnosed with cancer and wasn’t looking at all well<br>
He’d just turned ninety-seven was paralyzed all down one side<br>
Said “I wish someone would have the courage to help me get out of this hell…</p>

    <h2>Good Evening, Reverend</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Unravelled Tales - Volume 2, 2021</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Good evening, Reverend—I see you’ve kept your promise, then<br>
    You said you’d visit me—right up until the very end<br>
    I hope you haven’t come to try once more to save my soul<br>
    At dawn’s awakening, I’ll be swinging from the gallowspole </p>
 
    <p>Don’t ask me how I am, if you were me, how would you feel?<br>
    Born on the bottom rung to be blotted out by fortune’s wheel <br>
    I’s never counted-on, or expected to amount to much<br>
    If I’m recalled at all, it’ll be as a no good such-and-such</p>
 
    <p>I never met the girl—her name, I’m told, was Jennifer<br>
    Blessed with gorgeous looks, and fine, upstanding character <br>
    About her qualities, I’ve heard countless people testify<br>
    They called her “innocent”, and say “the innocent don’t deserve to die!” </p>
 
    <p>She told her parents, she and her friends were going out that night<br>
    She told those friends of hers, she was going to meet a boy she liked<br>
    She told the boy she liked, there was some pressing thing that needed done<br>
    They all expected her; she didn’t show for none of em</p>
 
    <p>They found her ravaged corpse discarded in a park nearby<br>
    Police found me there, too, drunk, without an alibi<br>
    She had been drunk as well, and this, they said, was evidence<br>
    The truth, however, is, it only was coincidence</p>
 
    <p>I couldn’t pay the bail; a lawyer, they appointed me<br>
    He couldn’t pronounce my name, but in his defense, he worked for free<br>
    They offered me a deal, said “Confess, and you’ll serve seventy” <br>
    But I refused to lie; they gave me the death penalty</p>
 
    <p>I read your bible through; in here, Lord knows, I’ve had the time<br>
    I paid attention, close, to the passages that you underlined<br>
    I recognized myself when they imprisoned Joseph wrongfully<br>
    And in Job’s lonesome wail, I found I’s in good company </p>
 
    <p>The thing I didn’t get is where it says that Jesus died for me,<br>
    if that’s the case, then, I’d like the guard to set me free<br>
    I know he won’t, though, tho he can quote the scripture, too<br>
    he says, “When God made his plans—tell me, sinner, where were you?”</p>
 
    <p>And you know what the worst part is? The climax of this tragedy—<br>
    That poor girl that was killed—her murderer’s still walking free <br>
    Perhaps he’ll kill again—I’ve prayed for him to, more than once <br>
    So that my death, if not my life, would be counted with the innocents</p>
 
    <p>I know I have to die, it’s something everyone must do<br>
    There ain’t a man alive who isn’t only passing through<br>
    The only difference, though, is that my appointment’s registered<br>
    On the warden’s calendar, 8:00a.m., October 3rd</p>
 
    <p>Don’t feel you have to talk, I can see you’d like to comfort me<br>
    To practice what you’ve learned in your school of the divinities<br>
    If all the plans are laid, then what’s the sense in groveling? <br>
    If you’d like to help me now, you can do the following:</p>
 
    <p>Tell my doctor there’s no need to send more medicine<br>
    Tell my debtors that I already have forgiven them<br>
    Tell my disciples my death is no martyrdom<br>
    Tell my country I wish I could have been its citizen</p>
 
    <p>Remind the Christians that Jesus was an only son<br>
    Ask the judges to consider where their power’s from<br>
    Tell my story often, and when you do, please say “unless something’s done<br>
    That this man’s tragic fate could be the same for you or anyone”</p>
 
    <p>Tell your followers if they want to win they’ll have to fight<br>
    Tell the lawyers—calling it their job won’t make it right <br>
    Tell your escort when you leave to please turn off the light—<br>
    Good evening, reverend—I hope you will sleep well tonight    </p>

    <p>Well the whistle is blowin in the factry, says the time for quittin’s almost come<br>
    Everybody all at once they say exactly just what they will do when they are done<br>
    Some say that they are goin drinkin, some say that they will join them for a few<br>
    Some just stand around like they are thinking, till someone asks them, “How bout you?”<br>
        I say, goodnight you workers and you dreamers<br>
        And those of you less tired than you thought<br>
        We’ll all get back to working in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I walked down to the corner of the b-line, just like I always do to catch the bus<br>
    Some women asked me if I’d like to have a good time, said, cause if you do, just come with us<br>
    I told them I was grateful for the invite, told them any other night I normally would<br>
    But as the bus had caught us in its headlight, I apologized and hoped they understood<br>
        I said, Goodnight all you well-wishing ladies<br>
        And to all the good-times you might’ve brought<br>
        We’ll all get back to lovin in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I rode the bus to where I normally go, half way there I must’ve fell asleep<br>
    When I woke up I was in the depot, and I couldn’t find my wallet or my keys<br>
    I figured that somebody’d gone and robbed me and I ran into the street to find a cop<br>
    I found and asked him if he could help me, he said, “Actually, to be honest, probably not,”<br>
        So I said, Goodnight you coppers and you robbers<br>
        And you bandits who’ve stolen all you’ve got<br>
        We’ll get back to our disputing in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I took to my heels and I started walking, as home was still a good few miles away<br>
    But I ran into a friend and we got to talkin, pulled me into the saloon and said he’d pay<br>
    Inside they had a jukebox goin, and every face was one I seemed to know<br>
    The whiskey like a river it was flowing, till at 4am the tender said twas time to go<br>
        So I said, goodnight you drunkards and you boozehounds<br>
        Goodnight steve and phil and chuck and bob<br>
        We’ll get back to drinkin in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I made it home just as the dawn was breaking, I felt like I had never been so beat<br>
    Every muscle in my body, it was achin, I could barely even stand to keep my feet<br>
    I climbed into my bedroom through my window, took off my shoes and pants and socks and shirt<br>
    I eased my body down into my pillow, fell asleep right just in time to go to work<br>
        So I said, Goodnight peaceful easy livin<br>
        Goodnight goodnight’s rest I never got<br>
        Tell those friends of mine, oh, if you see em<br>
        Tell em that I told you—thanks a lot!    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The heavy rain it falls in sheets<br>
    On empty cobbled lamplit streets<br>
    Through which a desperate man retreats<br>
        Hoping to receive the thing he’s paid for<br>
    Beneath the tower clock he waits<br>
    Upon his deeds he ruminates<br>
    He means to flee but hesitates<br>
        Trying to remember what he came for<br>
            With bloody hands he holds the rain<br>
            But whether his or someone else’s pain<br>
            He feels now passing slowly from his heart into his brain<br>
                There is no guessin</p>
 
    <p>A shape from out the shadow shows<br>
    That looks to be like one of those<br>
    He’s seen before and thinks he knows<br>
        If only for the wryness of the smile<br>
    It asks him: has the thing been done<br>
    He throws the shadow back its gun<br>
    With all the bullets there but one<br>
    That was used to kill the meantime for a while<br>
        The darkness as he begins to go<br>
        Says: but what about the pay I owe?<br>
        Don’t you want to hear me say what by now you must already know?<br>
            Or are we even?</p>
 
    <p>You run from justice and you run from strife<br>
    You’re tired of your ransomed life<br>
    Like Abraham you lift your knife<br>
        Obeying the commands that are provided<br>
    You’d like to be somebody else<br>
    You’d like to do things for yourself<br>
    For consolation you can keep your health<br>
    And hope the grieving soon will have subsided<br>
        You believe in everything you’re told<br>
        I’ve done so much worse for less than gold<br>
        But tell me for what price have you gone away and sold<br>
            What I gave unto ya?</p>
 
    <p>The portraits of the patriarchs<br>
    Went overboard to feed the sharks<br>
    You can hear the dog who cries and barks<br>
    Calling for the master who’s abused him<br>
    The soldiers sleep in tents in yards<br>
    While the wounded nurse removes the shards<br>
    Of razorblade behind her heart<br>
        That got there who knows how or for what reason<br>
            You’ve travelled on the beaten path<br>
            As men before and men since have<br>
            And you say some day we’ll both look back on this and laugh<br>
                To keep from cryin</p>
 
    <p>The swallower of swords has said<br>
    What doesn’t kill you will leave you dead<br>
    Worship your heart and you’ll lose your head<br>
        This is the only law you can get by on<br>
    I ain’t the devil and I sure ain’t God<br>
    But right now I’m all you’ve got<br>
    So you can quit me or take your best shot<br>
        Either way you can’t go back to where you came from<br>
            You lent to me your traitor’s kiss<br>
            Yes, and they’ll make you a man for this<br>
            Tell me when I’m gone do you suppose you’ll miss<br>
                Your old companion?</p>
 
    <p>The dice are rolled, the lot’s been cast<br>
    You’ll take the present with the past<br>
    The future’s not what comes at last<br>
        The future’s what precedes the end of knowing<br>
    The detectives organized the clues<br>
    The fingerprints and the bloody shoes<br>
    All the stupid words we used<br>
        Trying not to get where we were going<br>
            I know you knew it all along<br>
            In the name of God, what took so long?<br>
            For you to out and say that you’ve been wrong<br>
                From the beginning?</p>
 
    <p>A story may have many sides<br>
    An individual several lives<br>
    But all were killed and one survives<br>
        And I alone am he that’s left to tell it<br>
    So gentlemen and ladies, here<br>
    Of the jury, court, and everywhere<br>
    Bring your witness now to bear<br>
        Wherever the prosecution seeks to rest it<br>
            And the next time that they come for you<br>
            Be sure to tell them what to do<br>
            You thought you laid it out and saw it through<br>
                But you were mistaken<br>
    The fires in the hearths are low<br>
    The winter never means to snow<br>
    The wind it never tries to blow<br>
        But these things all must have their explanations<br>
    Inside the darkened mouths of thieves<br>
    Are rotten teeth and mustard seeds<br>
    Tongues that keep the truth diseased<br>
        And knowledge well contained by reservations<br>
            And know before they aim and shoot<br>
            You never loved me, you just followed suit<br>
            Your eyes were only ever set upon the loot<br>
                Of which there is none    </p>

    <h2>The Boomerang Song</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Unravelled Tales - Volume 2, 2021</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Once upon a long-lost time<br>
    I knew a girl so fair and fine<br>
    We met at a circus where I’d gone to see a show<br>
    She was swinging from a big trapeze<br>
    Dangling from her bended knee<br>
    From so high up it seemed that down was the only place to go<br>
        Suddenly a cymbal rang<br>
        She pulled out a wooden boomerang<br>
        Threw it hard and watched it circle all around the place<br>
    She caught it in her teeth and smiled<br>
    The audience was a goin wild<br>
    In my heart a feelin came I had to give it chase</p>
 
    <p>Well after I had seen her act<br>
    I couldn’t help a goin back<br>
    I watched her every evening for two whole solid weeks<br>
    The ticketman he learned my name<br>
    When he saw me, he’d say “You, again?”<br>
    Til finally he offered me the chance with her to speak<br>
        My opportunity came at last<br>
        My heart it was a goin fast<br>
        It was after her finale as he was countin up his stubs<br>
    He took me to her trailer car<br>
    Knocked and said, “Well, there y’are,”<br>
    She answered in her bathrobe and she asked me who I was</p>
 
    <p>(alternate)<br>
    I met her in an open field<br>
    Her name as yet, was unrevealed<br>
    But her eyes, they spoke in volumes and her manners, they were kind<br>
    She told me of her heritage<br>
    While I explained how rare it is <br>
    For any lonesome person a sympathetic soul to find<br>
        Suddenly it began to rain<br>
        She pulled out a wooden boomerang<br>
        Threw it hard and watched it sailing whooshing through the air<br>
    The lightning struck at it and missed<br>
    She caught it, said, “Now make a wish”<br>
    I said I wished where she was going that I might follow there</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
        and in a sort of funny way<br>
        you might just go ahead and say<br>
        that I’m a little like that old boomerang you threw<br>
        I make like I’m a gonna go<br>
        And then I do, and fore you know<br>
        Before I’ve gotten anywhere, I’m just a comin back to you</p>
 
    <p>Her hair was long her eyes were dark<br>
    Had a face just like a questionmark<br>
    For a time seemed like she only wanted to be rid of me<br>
    But I behaved a gentleman,<br>
    Fore too long we was like old friends<br>
    Who havn’t got agendas or any special place to be<br>
        We talked until the sun did rise<br>
        Morning took us by surprise<br>
        Her manager came by said it was time for getting on<br>
    She said I guess this means goodbye<br>
    She hung her head and began to cry<br>
    I told her if she’d let me, I’d be glad to come along</p>
 
    <p>I followed her from pennsylvane<br>
    From Portland, Oregon to Portland maine<br>
    Through the plains of Kansas to the scrapers of New York<br>
    a couple times I took the lead<br>
    we quarreled, fought, and disagreed<br>
    and every path we picked just brought us to another fork<br>
        so finally we parted ways<br>
        somewhere round the frisco bays<br>
        she went towards seattle and I to Tennessee<br>
    half way there I lost my horse<br>
    caught a driver headed west and north<br>
    who said, “This time tomorrow, Seattle’s where I’ll be,”</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>The next night I was in her town<br>
    Askin for her all around<br>
    Found a captain who had seen her hangin round the railroad track<br>
    I found her huddled round a blaze<br>
    Tellin stories of the hell we’d raised<br>
    Somebody asked about her partner and if he was comin back?<br>
        At this point I was well disguised <br>
        Had my hat pulled low down oer my eyes<br>
        She said, “if I never see his face again, it’ll be too soon”<br>
    She was smiling when she said it tho<br>
    I could see it in the fire-glow<br>
    And when she was through insulting me, she took me to her room</p>
 
    <p>Next morning, at the break of dawn<br>
    I awoke and found her gone<br>
    The note upon the doorknob said “please shut me when you leave”<br>
    Half-naked, I came down the stairs<br>
    An old lady screamed and said, “Who’s there?”<br>
    When I said “It’s only me,” she said, “I’m calling the police,”<br>
        Well I busted right on out the back<br>
        Never thought twice about looking back <br>
        The thought to hang around awhile did not to me occur<br>
    I ran down to the rail depot<br>
    I hopped a train that was movin slow<br>
    And was trying to catch my breath when I caught a glimpse of her</p>

    <h2>Justice And the Law</h2>

    <p>“Someone’s stolen my property!” the store owner did declare<br>
    Policeman turned the corner, found me standin there</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS:<br>
            In the next world you’ll get justice; in this world you get the law</p>
 
    <p>I said I didn’t do it, I said it wasn’t me<br>
    He put me into his handcuffs and threw away the key<br>
    Took me down to county, held me there all night<br>
    Wanted my confession, I said, “I know my rights!”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>They brought me in a lawyer, must’ve come straight from the bar,<br>
    He said, “You don’t have to use me, but if you don’t, you won’t get far,”<br>
    he said, “Why don’t you give up? It’s your only move! <br>
    the truth is not important if it’s nothin you can prove” <br>
        chorus </p>
 
    <p>we went before the judge and he said I’d been accused<br>
    of murder in the first degree, I said, “I think you’re confused!”<br>
    the judge he asked the lawyer, “How does the defendant plead?”<br>
    “Your honor,” he said “Guilty—of murder in the first degree!”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>They gave me twenty years to life with no chance of parole<br>
    Judge said, “May the Lord God have mercy on your soul”<br>
    They took me away from my family, took me away from my home<br>
    Threw me into the lockdown and left me all alone<br>
        chorus </p>
 
    <p>my wife she tried to stand by me, she protested and made waves<br>
    she had to quit the fight tho, she had two kids to raise<br>
    so I wrote a million letters, and my appeal date finally came<br>
    I tried a different strategy, but the outcome was the same<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>the officer who arrested me will be Commissioner any day<br>
    my old lawyer’s on the ballot to take the seat of the D.A.<br>
    the judge, he ran for office, history turned the page<br>
    now he’s livin in a big old mansion with a girlfriend his daughter’s age <br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>our justice system’s overwrought; it’s just stopped making sense<br>
    what good’s the law to anyone if can’t protect innocence?<br>
    If I had to describe it in a word or two or less <br>
    I’d say the American Incarceral State’s downright Kafkaesque<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Pilate said to Jesus, “If you’re his son, let God save you,”<br>
    Jesus said, “Forgive them, father, they don’t know what they do.”<br>
    The preacher here in prison he says “the truth will set you free—”<br>
    But to hell with his truth, it hasn’t done a thing for me <br>
        It don’t matter where it comes, it don’t matter how<br>
        The Law’s done nothing for me, I’m after justice now!     </p>

    <p>The fire marshall, on vacation / called his boys for information<br>
    But they weren’t at the station / They were nowhere to be found<br>
    And the papers didn’t mention / the gasoline the place was drenched in<br>
    between the garage and the engine / burning slowly to the ground<br>
        And here I am again to say<br>
    Here I am—just yesterday<br>
        Here I am—nearly spent<br>
        Here I am—a child, and reticent  to grow into my sorrow</p>
 
    <p>The prophesy was written / Abraham bore many children<br>
    then he went ahead and killed them / At the instruction of the Lord<br>
    and so Isaac wrote to Ishmael / who thought the letter was just junkmail<br>
    Live by the pen to die, still / at the destruction of the sword<br>
        Here I am, still getting by<br>
        Here I am—to make another try <br>
        Here I am—barely awake<br>
        Here I am, reluctant to ever take</p>
 
    <p>the criminal outfoxes the mandatory little boxes<br>
    as he gives a brief synopsis of his life up until now<br>
    Telling who and when and wherefore, and other things he’s been prepared for<br>
    implicating others, therefore, without ever saying how<br>
        here I am, on the run<br>
        here I am—t’bring what I’ve begun<br>
        here I am, alone at last<br>
        here I am—but will the past</p>
 
    <p>Now I’m sitting at the keyboard / trying to guess at my own password<br>
    The keystroke of the four-chord / sounding nothing like your name<br>
    While the bells in the cathedral / so archaic and medieval<br>
    Announce at evening that the weasel’s / brought the monkey to the game<br>
        And here I am, still hanging on<br>
        Here I am—waitin for the dawn<br>
        And here I am—not getting through<br>
        Here I am—like superglue</p>
 
    <p>And there’s nothing left to wonder / to take or steal or plunder<br>
    You’ve succumbed, and now you’re under / neath the sorceress’s spell<br>
    meanwhile somewhere music’s playing / and some listener’s obeying<br>
    A recorded voice that’s saying: “please return now to your cell”<br>
        And here I am, still on the ground<br>
        Here I am—tho try, by leap or bound<br>
        And here I am—the solitaire<br>
        Here I am—it’s not been fun or fair</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Went in to work first thing this morning<br>
    First thing that happens, with no kind of warning<br>
    My boss comes up lookin kind of fraught<br>
    says he wants to see me today in his office at three o’clock <br>
        Am I fired?<br>
        I wondered </p>
 
    <p>Well I figure it’s curtains for me, I guess<br>
    So I took the liberty of cleanin out my desk<br>
    At 3pm I’m outside his door<br>
    With a few other folks who work on my floor<br>
        We give a knock<br>
        The door opens…</p>
 
    <p>Inside there’s this crowd of people huddlin<br>
    In front of em’s our boss, he’s explaining something<br>
    He says, “…now I don’t want to hear no more of your complaining<br>
    We’re going to sit through this active shooter training—<br>
        And you’re gonna like it!<br>
        Might even learn something—!</p>
 
    <p>He introduces the keynote speaker<br>
    This fella dressed in Kevlar from helmet to sneaker<br>
    He’s a retired cop and an ex-marine<br>
    Says he’s here to tell us about some of what he’s seen<br>
        In the line of duty<br>
        The field of battle</p>
 
    <p>He says, “I was in Colorado in ‘99<br>
    When the call came through from Columbine;<br>
    few years later they had me take a look<br>
    at what went wrong at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook<br>
        that church in Charleston<br>
        and the Orlando Night-club…”</p>
 
    <p>He says, “Nowadays you can’t be too prepared<br>
    A mass shooting can happen most anywhere:<br>
    In churches, synagogues, concert halls,<br>
    Schools, playgrounds, dance-clubs, malls<br>
        They’re happening wherever there’s people gathering, really<br>
        The more the scarier</p>
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>He says “I wish I could give you a rule of thumb<br>
    But the truth is, an active shooter can look like anyone<br>
    They can be young, middle-aged, elderly<br>
    They can look like you or you or—even me!<br>
        Then he grins real big<br>
        Pulls out his pistol</p>
 
    <p>He says, “I ain’t your boss, but if it were up to me<br>
    You can bet it’d be mandatory<br>
    Everybody in here would own a gun<br>
    And would be well trained in how to go about using one<br>
        Says he’s got one in every room of his house<br>
        Keeps a loaded one under his pillow</p>
 
    <p>He said, “In schools now they’re given guns to teachers<br>
    In churches they’re giving guns to preachers<br>
    If it were up to me and I could get my say<br>
    Every red-blooded one of you’d join the NRA<br>
         And he pulls out his membership card<br>
        And an armload of pamphlets</p>
 
    <p>About here he pauses and says, “Are there any questions?<br>
    Comments? Insights? Thoughts? Suggestions?”<br>
    There’s something I couldn’t quite understand<br>
    So I waited a minute, put up my hand<br>
        He says, “You there! Scrawny guy!<br>
    Shoot!”</p>
 
    <p>I said “I’m sorry if I find this a bit confusin<br>
    but if guns are the problem, then shouldn’t the solution—”<br>
    He cuts me off like he’s all offended<br>
    Starts reciting the second amendment<br>
        Says: who ever said guns was the problem?<br>
        Guns don’t kill people—crazy people do!</p>
 
    <p>I asked if he could define his terms a little<br>
    The nation’s full of crazy people<br>
    I’m no scholar but to me it seems<br>
    it’d be harder to kill people if they didn’t have the means<br>
        He said now you’re talkin crazy</p>
 
    <p>In America you’re free to buy a gun<br>
    Go outside and shoot someone<br>
    If you’re wealthy, white and affluent<br>
    You can claim you did it in self-defense<br>
        You’ll get away with murder, <br>
    if you’re a officer—</p>
 
    <p>You don’t have to take em all away<br>
    but to make a few more of em illegal might be okay<br>
    I mean, does anyone need an automatic weapon<br>
    for target practice, deer and rabbit huntin?<br>
        Shootin pop bottles off a picket fence? </p>
 
    <p>And maybe we’d not need so much gun protection<br>
    If the manufacturers didn’t make it so easy to get em<br>
    And maybe there’d be effective legislative solutions<br>
    If politicians’d quit taking NRA campaign contributions<br>
        Hell, I don’t know<br>
    It’s just a thought…    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>A borrowed suit emerging from a rented limousine<br>
    At an empty filling station, a mile from the red car-pet—<br>
    The tank now overflowing, covers him in gasoline<br>
    He takes a step back to ignite himself one final cigarette<br>
        And while they pray and pray—even as the angels sing<br>
        Their eyes they stray, when their miracle appears— <br>
        Someplace else maybe you’d think to call it interesting<br>
        But o, you know it’s just another day round here</p>
 
    <p>The girlfriend of the governor finally made it to his place<br>
    When he got there, she was laughing with his wife who had made tea<br>
    As a curious expression made its way onto his face<br>
    She calmly said, “It’s a funny thing your wife here was telling me,” <br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>At the meeting of the generals they’ve begun gambling with souls<br>
    Disputing lines they’ve scribbled on a map that’s poorly drawn<br>
    The leaders of large countries endorsing things they won’t divulge<br>
    Til someone blows the whistle and turns the war back on<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Running rampant in the castle’s vacant halls<br>
    The ghost of Hamlet dancing with a goblet of champagne<br>
    Candlepin bowling with the madame’s crystal ball<br>
    Shouting slander from the parapet, prophesying rain<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Flotsam floating in the mind’s discrete mirage<br>
    Reveals a keepsake stolen from a bookcase that was a door<br>
    Later it will turn up in some framed-criminal’s garage<br>
    Who will turn it over, saying, “I’ve never seen that thing before—”<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Inside the Zone there are still many places you can’t go<br>
    “There’s too much radiation” read the signs in foreign words<br>
    You could build a mighty fortress with all the things you’ll never know<br>
    If you hadn’t written off impossibles as being for the birds<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>the city hides an alley where a man holds out a cup<br>
    he rings a bell on Christmas Eve, dressed as Santa Claus<br>
    he’s dying and he knows it but he can’t seem to give up<br>
    the thought that someone will take pity and give unto his cause<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>the hero from his armchair gazes at the frozen scene<br>
    a painting he was given for his bravery in the war<br>
    in the quiet of the lamplight he still hears the dead marines<br>
    while his wife in the nursery shouts, “I can’t take this anymore—”<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>stamping passports at the entrance of the gate<br>
    an official’s asking everyone the purpose of their trip:<br>
    a man who’s fleeing circumstance, leaving home because of hate <br>
    is told: I’m sorry, sir, your answer doesn’t seem to fit<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Jesus on the cross cried out “Why has thou Forsaken me?<br>
    Did I not accomplish everything that you desired?”<br>
    God said nothing but someone shouted pityingly,<br>
    “hey man don’t you realize you’ve just been preaching to the choir?”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>The asylum after midnight is an escalating plot:<br>
    A wheelchair has gone missing and a patient can’t be found<br>
    Someone’s dumped the medication in the nurse’s coffee pot<br>
    Any minute now the fire-alarm is probably going to sound<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>the tax-man’s come to gather up the store-owner’s receipts<br>
    but he’s out collecting mercy from the parson, for his soul <br>
    while the barber’s window takes a brick thrown in by the police<br>
    the farmer’s out to pasture, being gored by his own bull<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>America the beautiful for all your amber waves of grain<br>
    for instituting freedom with a rifle and a cage<br>
    For perfect mountain majesties above the fruited plain<br>
    For corruption, waste, hypocrisy, insanity and rage<br>
        chorus    </p>

    On Broad St, Philadelphia PA<br>
    I’m half-dead where I’m standing but I’m trine to look alive<br>
    I tell myself, “You never know, today might be the day—” <br>
    They burst in all disheveled with their hopes out on a limb<br>
    Every one of them surviving on a prayer<br>
    They can all tell you the story about their big ship coming in<br>
    But you’ve already seen the harbor, and you know it isn’t there—<br>
        Lord knows, I hate to be the bearer of bad news <br>
        But I’m afraid you’re out of luck again, today—<br>

    <p>Mr. Pomerantz on food-stamps he got robbed again last night<br>
    While sleeping in the threshold of a shop<br>
    He was thrown out of the shelter for starting up a fight<br>
    Though in his mind he was only trying to make the violence stop;<br>
    He’s waiting on a new card coming from the CAO<br>
    When it gets here it will mean that he can eat;<br>
    Til then he’ll be on exit ramps panhandling for dough<br>
    Shakin his empty coffee-can at strangers on the street<br>
        Lord knows I hate to be the bearer of bad news<br>
        To knock the wind from right out of a sail—<br>

    <p>Jane Finnegan is in again, still going on about<br>
    How her folks are sending money from the farm<br>
    They think she’s still in college, don’t know yet that she dropped out<br>
    And took up a nasty habit that’s puttin holes into her arm<br>
    She’s been in and out of detox, says she’s trying to get clean<br>
    She can’t say it without drawing up a tear<br>
    she says, “Soon as I get that money, I’ll buy a ticket for the train—<br>
    to anywhere, I don’t care, long as it’s far away from here—”<br>
        Lord knows I hate to be the bearer of bad news<br>

        I wish I could tell her something that could cure her blues…<br>

    He looks tired and he says his feet are sore<br>
    The guards released him sometime early morning yesterday <br>
    But his clothes, wallet and money all got sent out the day before—<br>
    He’s in need of food, employment, and most of all, some place to stay<br>
    His PO thinks he’s got somewhere to be<br>
    Three months ago he got word his grandmother passed away<br>
    She was his only living family, his only chance at staying free—<br>
        Lord knows I hate to be the bearer of bad news<br>
        To see a man caught tween a graveyard and a jail<br>
        I wish I could relieve him of what he’s been accused<br>

    Where he went he said, to “be all he could be”<br>
    One night he found a landmine planted by the Taliban<br>

    He’s got a letter from the VA, says they couldn’t save his house<br>
    Tho they appealed his case to eleven different banks<br>

    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Hey, babe—will you step out of that shadow<br>
    Will you open up your window?<br>
        I’m down here in the rain<br>
        Throwin pebbles from the drain<br>
        And I gotta say my aim—it ain’t so good<br>
    Hey babe, will you just listen for a second<br>
    I know you haven’t called or beckoned me<br>
        I came of my own free will<br>
        At the risk of falling ill<br>
        To see if you were still up and in this neighborhood</p>
 
    <p>But it was only the errand of a fool, I see<br>
        Like you were waiting up for someone, and that someone wasn’t me</p>
 
    <p>Hey, babe—I can tell that you been crying<br>
    You say you weren’t but you’re just lyin, now<br>
        You got water on your dress<br>
        And I don’t mean to press<br>
        But how do you suggest that I think otherwise?<br>
    Hey, babe—you don’t have to act so perfect<br>
    You can’t be blamed for every serpent tongue<br>
        That slithers down to ask<br>
        While you’re walkin your own path<br>
        Whether something from your past has gone unrecognized</p>
 
    <p>But it’s only the remnant of a dream, I’m sure<br>
        Like recollections of a place you feel you’ve been but never were</p>
 
    <p>Hey, babe—are you alright, you look a little<br>
    Like you been cut right through the middle<br>
        Like your mind’s been sawn in two <br>
        And you don’t know what to do<br>
        But your sure it can’t be you there in the bathroom meer<br>
    Hey, babe—won’t you tell me what’s the trouble<br>
    You spelled it out but much too subtly<br>
        I’ve never been to sharp<br>
        And you got me in the dark<br>
        And I think I missed the mark you left somewhere round here</p>
 
    <p>But it’s only a hieroglyphic drawn in sand<br>
        Even if I could perceive it I’m sure I still wouldn’t understand</p>
 
    <p>Hey, babe—can I just say that I’m sorry<br>
    If I hurt you with my story<br>
        You know I never meant<br>
        For it to go the way it went<br>
        The impression that I’m lent is that it left you sore<br>
    Hey, babe—I don’t need you to say nothing<br>
    Words are cheap, a dime a dozen<br>
        I give em out for free<br>
        And they just come back to me<br>
        Likes waves upon the sea crashing on the shore    </p>

    <h2>Next Best Thing</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>When you’re all through lookin for prince charming<br>
    Who’s no more than a wolf in sheep’s clothes<br>
    When you’ve tried on all the glass slippers<br>
    And not one has left room for your toes</p>
 
    <p>When you’re tired of putting up posters<br>
    Advertisements, pictures and flyers<br>
    When you’ve reviewed each application<br>
    And there’s a good deal left to be desired</p>
 
    <p>I’ll be right here waiting<br>
        You don’t have to explain a thing<br>
        I’m plain as they come—no one’s number one<br>
        But if you’re lonesome, I’m the next best thing</p>
 
    <p>When you’re tired of keeping a standard<br>
    So high even birds fall quite short<br>
    When you’ve called in all of your favors<br>
    And are desperate for some last resort</p>
 
    <p>When you can’t tell how long you’ve been crying<br>
    Whether anybody out there’s hearing ya<br>
    When you’re ready to throw out the rulebook<br>
    For a new set of criteria</p>
 
    <p>I’ll be right here waiting<br>
        I ain’t gonna bite you or sting<br>
        It’s no big surprise—I’m nobody’s prize<br>
        But if you’re lonesome, I’m the next best thing</p>
 
    <p>When your heart can’t take any more teasing<br>
    And your tongue just can’t tell one more lie<br>
    And the size of your sorrow’s increasing<br>
    And each breath you breathe’s just a sigh</p>
 
    <p>When you’re twisted from all of the pressure<br>
    That’s on you to find someone to love<br>
    Which you don’t even know how to measure<br>
    Short of shrinking neath what you’re above</p>
 
    <p>I’ll be right here waiting<br>
        Off the mainstage in the back of the wing<br>
        I’m not the star of the show—I’m no one’s hero<br>
        But if you’re lonesome I’m the next best thing     </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>We arrive at the picture show an hour fore it starts<br>
    What I call entertainment you call art<br>
    You always cry at the funniest parts<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You take the high road and I take the low<br>
    When I’m in a hurry you’re movin slow<br>
    I say, “You know what?” and you already know<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You ain’t like other people, you’re a diamond in the rough<br>
    You’re shy in front of strangers, but you act so tough<br>
    You don’t like much attention, you’re very quick to blush<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>The only time you need me’s when your parking meter’s done<br>
    You ask me for a quarter and I give you one<br>
    You rack a hundred dollar ticket cause you give it to a bum<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>Whenever it’s your birthday, you never ask for gifts<br>
    I bring you wine and roses, you say what’s all this?<br>
    You don’t see the sense in celebrating the fact that you exist<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You never do what’s fashionable, you make up your own trends<br>
    If the ladies room is crowded, you just use the men’s <br>
    I don’t understand you sometimes, you don’t make any sense<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You never draw outside the lines, you follow all the rules<br>
    When it comes to bein punctual you’re stubborn as a mule<br>
    You’ve never heard of james dean, you think peter lorre’s cool<br>
        That’s why I love you    </p>

    <h2>Closest I Ever Came</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I’m wounded—some arrow must’ve caught me off guard<br>
    I can’t see my own hand in this place, it’s so dark<br>
    Lady luck must’ve held out to deal me these cards<br>
    In this light, every bull’s eye’s a big questionmark<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I only wanted to feel like I wasn’t insane<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>I’m not one to accomplish whatever I set out to do<br>
    There’s only so much that one person can try<br>
    Using brass-tacks and duct-tape, adhesives and glue<br>
    You can stop all the holes but it don’t mean you can fly<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someway to keep out of the rain<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>Over and over I ask myself: Why?—<br>
    at what point, exactly, did my intentions stray?<br>
        I can’t help but feel, no matter how hard I try<br>
        The whole time, it was only an armslength away </p>
 
    <p>I’ve sought buried treasure using antique maps<br>
    I’ve travelled extensively on the rumor of jewels<br>
    I’ve interviewed strangers, collected their facts<br>
    Withstood the judgment of prophets and fools<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted money, power, fortune and fame—<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>Don’t say it, you don’t have to—I’m goin away<br>
    These words are the last you’ll hear from me for a time<br>
    It gets more confusing the longer I stay<br>
    It’s not working out for you—and that’s fine<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someone who’d take her share of the blame<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>BRIDGE<br>
 
    <p>The search must continue, what can I do but go on?<br>
    I’ll keep movin til I find a new home, I suppose<br>
    Where some lonesome lady’s waiting up for the dawn<br>
    Prayin for respite from all that she knows <br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someone who knew me by my name<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>Time’s passing—I’m agin—getting older each day<br>
    There’s more to look back on than ahead to by now<br>
    I thought I’d be happy, but what can I say?<br>
    I believed it back then, and always knew it somehow<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someway of easing my pain<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>You still can’t decide if it’s better to hide or to come out wearing your blues<br>
    When push comes to shove you’re able to love just as far as you’re willing to lose<br>
    You’ve poured out your cup but it keeps filling up flowing over again<br>
    As what was collides with what might have been<br>
        What might’ve been if only we’d known<br>
        We might’ve turned round we might’ve come home<br>
        We might’ve grown old, we might’ve been shown<br>
        A way of our own<br>
        Through thick and thin<br>
        And gone it alone<br>
            I just can’t say when</p>
 
    <p>Your foregone concern as you try to relearn how to let go and how to hold on<br>
    Is with whether or not you’ve already forgot how he’s right here now that he’s gone<br>
    The tables’ve turned upon what you discerned to be the difference between you and them<br>
    Without ever once giving up you had to give in<br>
        Had to give in if only to sleep<br>
        Every once in a while, maybe once in a week<br>
        Or once you’ve come back <br>
        From making the leap<br>
        And stopping the leak<br>
        By going all in<br>
        On this losing streak<br>
            I just can’t say when</p>
 
    <p>Your only defense as you try to make sense of this trial you’ve put yourself through<br>
    Is how you’re consoled by your lack of control and you realize it might’ve been you<br>
    You’re trine to accept what you couldn’t expect would be waiting for you on the wind<br>
    He wasn’t my brother by blood but he was my friend<br>
        He was my friend, you told to them all<br>
        As they lent you their ears and let their eyes fall<br>
        And backed away slow<br>
        Saying nothing at all<br>
        Not like I don’t know<br>
        The way it’ll go<br>
        The way that it’s been<br>
        There’ll be tomorrow<br>
            I just can’t say when</p>
 
    <p>The time it moves fast but you cant feel it pass as you sit up and talk with the moon<br>
    This mountain of grief can be moved with belief but all anyone brought is a spoon<br>
    You’re tryin so hard not to let down your guard but now that you know how it ends<br>
    It might as well break wherever it bends<br>
        Right where it bends, before it deserts<br>
        And they ask you to say right where it hurts<br>
        And you show up one morning <br>
        Wearing one of his shirts<br>
        That you pulled from the dirt<br>
        And you tried to convert<br>
        But you just disconcert<br>
        I know that it hurts<br>
        I know where it hurts<br>
        I know how it hurts<br>
        I know why it hurts<br>
            I just can’t say when    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>There’s a feeling in the atmosphere that a storm’s about to break<br>
    The sky’s about as bruised as it could be<br>
    If I don’t tell her how I feel it’ll be my own mistake<br>
    A girl like that won’t wait around for me</p>
 
    <p>The forecast says precipitation’s likely—99%<br>
    I guess that means there’s still a chance it won’t<br>
    But there I go inventing each explanation to prevent<br>
    Me from doing what I ought to if I don’t</p>
 
    <p>Here goes nothing I suppose<br>
        To tell her I love her and show her how<br>
        I been saving for a rainy day—and hey, what do you know? <br>
    It’s raining now</p>
 
    <p>the weatherman’s been drawing crazy circles on his chart<br>
    he says he thinks it’s going to rain on our parade<br>
    is there something I can do to help in case this falls apart<br>
    what was it just now you were going to say?</p>
 
    <p>It started kind of gentle now it’s raining cats and dogs<br>
    I regret that I’m not a little more prepared<br>
    First I’m stranded in the desert, now I’m trapped in the mirage<br>
    It might look to brave to you from out there, but truth be told I’m scared</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I looked out my attic window, it’s still morning but it’s dark<br>
    I feel like I’ve still got a lot to say<br>
    My next-door neighbor, Noah, built himself a little ark<br>
    Awhile ago I watched him sail away</p>
 
    <p>If it weren’t for drought season I’d’ve probably already drowned<br>
    I’m not one who’s been known for making plans<br>
    the survivor in me’s thinking we should head for higher ground<br>
    but the thought of leaving you’s what keeps me standing where I am—</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>she was married when I met her but it was hanging by a thread<br>
    I’d good reason to believe that she’d wanted me instead<br>
    I’ll never know just how the thought ever got into my head—<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I smelled her honeysuckle so I followed where it lead<br>
    A line of fools stood at her door with gifts of wine and bread <br>
    I asked if they had thought to knock, they told me, “Go right ahead,”<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I could’ve swore she did—I could’ve swore she did<br>
        She always was the kind to keep her thoughts under a lid<br>
        If I’d money to wager on, I’d of surely lost the bid<br>
        I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did </p>
 
    <p>I’s admitted to her parlor by a butler in a wig<br>
    I shook hands with her father and he asked me what I did<br>
    I told him off the record that I aimed to make it big<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I spied her on the landing hearing every word I said<br>
    She descended as my face was turning every shade of red<br>
    I asked her out to dinner and she took me straight to bed<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I could’ve swore she did—I could’ve swore she did<br>
        Every look she gave me said that she was interested<br>
        I’s never one to fall in love, but I tripped and slipped and slid <br>
        I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>Afterwards I watched her as she rolled her cigarette<br>
    then smiled at me mysteriously and told me how I did<br>
    To me the word “tomorrow” sounded like an empty threat<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>She asked me what my name was, where I’d lived and what I’d read<br>
    I told her and she laughed and said, “My God, you’re just a kid!”<br>
    She showed me out the back door, though I begged her and I plead—<br>
    I know she never loved me but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>interlude<br>
 
    <p>Along life’s lonesome highway I’ve drifted and I’ve sped<br>
    Love is a thought the likes of which by now I’ve gotten rid<br>
    Alone into this world I’s born, and alone I’ll be when I’m dead<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did    </p>

    <p>Once I thought I had you pegged as one of those who knew the world<br>
    You spoke of it so plainly<br>
    Alluded to it in the past-tense mainly<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That you’ve always been uncertain<br>
        About what’s just behind the curtain<br>
        Afraid to name the thing that’s hurtin you so badly<br>
            Funny, I never knew—silly me</p>
 
    <p>Once I thought dreams could come true, anyone could be whatever they put their minds<br>
    Or backs into becoming<br>
    The gun is fired, the racers are off and running<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That it ain’t the dream that drives you<br>
        That determines or decides you<br>
        That undoes and divides you any way it can, you see<br>
            Funny, I thought it was—silly me</p>
 
    <p>Once I thought I found true love awaiting me in the most<br>
    Obvious of places<br>
    Wearing one of its million faces<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That love has its disguises<br>
        As many let-downs as surprises<br>
        And its veteran advises to look only after you leap<br>
            Funny, I didn’t know—silly me</p>
 
    <p>Once I thought I had it bad; I’d taken all the beatings<br>
    That this world had to give me<br>
    I had the scars to show and to carry with me<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That sure the current’s slowin<br>
        But the rivers still strongly flowin<br>
        And no matter how well you’re rowin<br>
        Signs of stopping it ain’t showing<br>
        You know you really had me goin—for a while there it seems<br>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>It started out small, well within my control<br>
    Steady as she goes, man, that’s always the goal<br>
    You give it a push, you feel the nudge of a pull<br>
    Suddenly what you’re chasin’s gone and swallowed you whole<br>
        And if you—were me<br>
        I bet you would already know<br>
        Just what to do—to get free<br>
        Of feelin like you got nowhere to go</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
            At the end of my rope and I got nowhere to fall<br>
            I’m in over my head, I feel kinda small<br>
            Funny, I always thought I was tall<br>
                And ain’t it a drag how hard you can try and it don’t make any </p>
 
    <p>I reached for my hat, she took a hold of my hand<br>
    I bid her goodevening, she did not understand<br>
    She said to speak up, said to say where I stand<br>
    Next thing you know she’s got the whole wedding planned<br>
        And if you were me<br>
        You’d’ve known it, I spose, right from the start<br>
        That what the eyes can see<br>
        Ain’t half of what’s there to be seen by the heart</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>They gave me a job, so we bought a house<br>
    Moved in together, now I sleep on the couch<br>
    I asked someone to pinch me, I said “Ouch,”<br>
    Now I wished I had the sense to put my foot in my mouth<br>
        And if you were me<br>
        Tell me what would be your next move<br>
        Would you stay or leave<br>
        This has moved well beyond any point I may have been trying to prove</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I travel the world, I see my old friends<br>
    I say it’s been too long, they say how long’s it been<br>
    I tell em the news, they say, Tell It Again<br>
    They say I’ll be find but they don’t ever say when<br>
        And if they only knew<br>
        How hard they can be, sometimes, to please<br>
        Maybe then I could make do<br>
        Without glimpsing a sight of the forest from the trees</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Rain’s gonna fall, sun’s gonna rise<br>
    Life’s gonna pass you in the blink of an eye<br>
    And whether you’re foolish, whether you’re wise<br>
    It don’t make no difference because everyone dies<br>
        And it’s hard to believe<br>
        That it’s ever gonna happen to me<br>
        I been alive for so long<br>
        I forget that there’s any other way I could be</p>

    If you don’t ask, I won’t give no reason—I won’t take any more than I brought.”<br>
    I told her I’d be there tomorrow, right at the first light of dawn<br>
    But this morning I knocked on her window, her neighbor said she’d already gone<br>
        “Did she leave any note? Did she tell you how come?<br>
        Did she give any good reason why?<br>
        I never had time to explain what I done<br>
        Or got the chance to tell her—goodbye.”</p>
 
    <p>Well I knew she was here on a visit, that she didn’t intend to stay long<br>
    But I remember her now like a music that my whole life’s just been following long<br>
    I recall how she kept at a distance and seemed so reluctant to show<br>
    Any feelin at the mention of lovers whose stories you already know<br>
        Still—I meant to explain the rules of the game<br>
        On the off-chance she intended to fly<br>
        But I never obtained so much as her name<br>
        Or got the chance to tell her goodbye</p>
 
    <p>Now I know that I shouldn’t be jealous of the sly things that other folks do<br>
    There isn’t a brave soul among us in this world who ain’t just passin through<br>
    I know that I’m no less as likely to seem just as vague and aloof<br>
    To shine as dimly or as brightly to any person of comparable youth<br>
        But I just can’t digest the feelin, I guess<br>
        That some people just act much too shy<br>
        I never bestowed any more than hello<br>
        Or got the chance to tell her goodbye    </p>

    <h2>Why Should I Be Kind To My Neighbor</h2>

    <p>In the states we got capitalism,<br>
    Seems to serve some pretty well—<br>
    The rich have the money and power<br>
    Rest of us are going to hell—<br>
    But it’s the same rules governing nature: <br>
    “only the fittest survive”<br>
    But whether you’re fit or a failure<br>
    Seems like everyone wants to know “Why—?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
        Why should I be kind to my neighbor? <br>
        Tell me, what’s in it for me?<br>
        Why should I do him a favor? <br>
        When he ain’t done nothing for me? <br>
        There ain’t no money in kindness<br>
        Nobody ever got rich doing good<br>
        You want me to be kind to my neighbor<br>
        Tell me again why I should—</p>
 
    <p>Well the teachers are up in the classrooms<br>
    They’re doing the best that they can<br>
    to keep all their kids out of trouble<br>
    to give every child some sort of plan<br>
    they’re teaching them science and history<br>
    English, geography, math<br>
    but what do they tell to the children<br>
    who put up their hands just to ask:</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>The preachers are up in their pulpits<br>
    They’re tellin everyone to do right<br>
    They say we should all be like Jesus<br>
    They’re tryin to fight the good fight<br>
    They tell all about all the wisdom he shared<br>
    How he lived his whole life without sin—<br>
    How he tried to stand up to the empire…<br>
    But won’t you look at what happened to him—so:</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>In the states we all got our freedom<br>
    We got our American Dream<br>
    The freedom to say it’s all dandy<br>
    And to pretend things are just as they seem<br>
    But as far as a strong moral compass<br>
    We gave up on that quest long-ago<br>
    Preferring, instead, the old mindset<br>
    that’s hung up on wanting to know:</p>

    <p>Gather round me children and I’ll teach you the way<br>
    You can grow up to be like your role models today<br>
    To talk like a true-blue bona-fide head of state<br>
    If you want to elude any kind of question<br>
    Just pay attention to these here suggestions<br>
    And in no time at all you’ll be able to prevaricate <br>
        You don’t need to believe in no superstition<br>
        To learn to talk like a politician<br>
        All you got to do is look innocently <br>
        At your accusers and say, on three (one, two, three)<br>
            Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t<br>
            Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it isn’t<br>
            Maybe that’s a yes, maybe that’s a big fat no<br>
            When you got no cause, no case, no proof<br>
            Maybe maybe’s the closest you can get to the truth<br>
            Maybe we ought to just let the whole thing go</p>
 
    <p>Adam and eve in the garden of eden<br>
    Were told about a fruit they should refrain from eatin<br>
    God said, “If you ever do, by god it’ll be a sin”<br>
    One day as the good lord was passin on by<br>
    He caught sight of the couple out the corner of his eye<br>
    Wearing clothes behind which they was trine to hide from him<br>
        He called em over said, Adam and eve<br>
        What are you doin wearin them old fig-leaves?<br>
        Who do you spose you are tryin to fool?<br>
        Did you go ahead and break my one and only rule?<br>
            Maybe we did, maybe we didn’t<br>
            Maybe it’s our fault, maybe it isn’t<br>

    <p>Old man Washington had a cherry tree<br>
    Yielded lots of cherries sweet as can be<br>
    His wife used to gather em to make her famous pie<br>
    One day the old man went into town,<br>
    Came back found that old tree chopped down<br>
    The sight brought tears of rage into his tired eyes<br>
        In his loudest voice he called to his only son<br>
        Said, George, get out here—and George, he come<br>
        Said, George, don’t you tell no lie to me<br>
        Was it you who cut down my cherry tree?<br>

    <p>William Clinton was an American president<br>
    Had a reputation that was without precedent<br>
    Swore to protect and serve his country all his life<br>
    One day word broke about some sort of affair<br>
    That gave everybody a little bit of a scare<br>
    He’d been publicly accused of cheating on his wife<br>
        Well they called a meeting, and they called the press<br>
        Tried to make old Bill confess<br>
        Everybody thought they had him caught<br>
        When they said did you have relations with that woman or not?<br>

    <h2>Easier Said Than Done</h2>

    <p>In the beginning all was darkness, there was a black wind on the waves<br>
    God said, “Someone turn a light on, please,” and the light he called, the day<br>
    The dark he called the night-time, and then he counted to one<br>
    And when the first day, it was finished, he said, “It was easier said than done,”</p>
 
    <p>It’s easier said than done<br>
        Startin off with less than none<br>
        Workin up towards having some<br>
        Getting past where you’re comin from<br>
        Its simpler lost than won<br>
        Likelier left than brung<br>
        Oftener spoke than sung<br>
        It’s easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>Second day God made the heavens, set em high above the earth<br>
    Then he said, “Now I’ll make what’s left to make of this here universe,”<br>
    And when the sea below the sky above he’d separated from<br>
    He reached down to wash his hands, said “It was easier said than done.”</p>
 
    <p>The Third day he made the oceans, made the rivers and the seas<br>
    The lands were carpeted with grasses and he outfitted them with trees<br>
    And out upon their branches grew the peach, the pear, the plum<br>
    And when he thought about it he thought, “It was easier said than done.”</p>
 
    <p>Fourth day he installed the stars and thereby designed the night<br>
    Then he put in all the planets and he thought it looked alright<br>
    Then he sent em in a circle goin all around the sun<br>
    And when he’d had a better look, he said “It was easier said than done.”</p>
 
    <p>Fifth day God made the creatures for the waters and the skies<br>
    Made the swordfish and the mollusk and the seagull and magpie<br>
    He said, “Let there be mosquitoes, and let them breed upon the scum,”<br>
    And lo and behold it was—and it was easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>Sixth day God made the zebra, he made the lion and the ox,<br>
    He made the lemur and the elephant and the hound-dog and the fox<br>
    He said, “From out of dust and ashes let the human beings come,”<br>
    And so people were created—and it was easier said than done.</p>
 
    <p>The Seventh day, God spoke to Adam right before he took his rest,<br>
    Said, “Do you promise to take care of this?” Adam said, “We’ll do our best,”<br>
    God was satisfied to trust him, but from the world he stood among<br>
    Adam seemed to know too well it would be easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>Well I guess some time has passed since then and now the world is getting old<br>
    The oceans have been traveled and the lands have all been sold<br>
    And some would say there’s nothing new beneath that aging sun<br>
    Some would say that proving that would be easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>But me I say the problems of the world ain’t yet been solved<br>
    People aint stopped killin folks, our problems ain’t resolved<br>
    Until the bells of mercy in the halls of justice have been rung<br>
    Love will always be a thing that’s easier said than done</p>

    <p>I knew a man, he had a lover<br>
    One day she killed him with a kitchen knife<br>
    she learned he’d been out with another<br>
    who, it turned out, the whole time, had been his wife<br>
        It’s hard to always do the right thing<br>
        It’s never an open-and-shut case<br>
        I’d rather have my cake—and eat it, too<br>
        But you can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>I know a man, had life insurance<br>
    Big old million dollar claim<br>
    He faked his death in a disappearance<br>
    now he can’t tell anyone his name<br>
        It’s hard to always do the right thing<br>
        It’s hard to know just what to chase <br>
        If I knew what I now know, a long time ago… <br>
        But you can’t always have it both ways </p>
 
    <p>Jesus Christ had many a follower<br>
    He said, “You can come along, too, if you decide,<br>
    But you can’t worship that almighty dollar<br>
    And go round thinkin you’re on my side<br>
    I know its hard to always do the right thing<br>
        When the right thing don’t hardly pay<br>
        I’d rather be a good and a rich man, <br>
        But you know you can’t always have it both ways”</p>
 
    <p>You can have all of our memories to speak to<br>
    Apologize to em, one by one<br>
    You can take all the time and words you need to<br>
    But you can’t undo what you done<br>
        And its hard to always do the right thing<br>
        The right thing changes every day<br>
        I’d rather need you—and be needed, too<br>
        But you can’t always have it both ways    </p>

    <p>Well I had me a girlfriend a while ago; I loved her, and she loved me<br>
    So I got the crazy notion to ask her if she’d want to start a family<br>
    She said yes, we both got dressed and went before the priest<br>
    He said “Anyone know why these two shouldn’t wed?  Speak now or hold your peace!” </p>
 
    <p>Well grandpa jumped up in his mighty old age and he said “there’s one reason I can see<br>
    Getting married’s not all fun and games, it’s a lot of responsibility<br>
    I don’t want to say you can’t do it, it’s just that there’s a lot to risk<br>
    Soon as you have kids, they’ll take all you got, then forget that you exist—</p>
 
    <p>And that’s all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        All the thanks you’ll get<br>
        You work hard to keep a roof abovem<br>
        They call you liar when you tellem you love em <br>
        All the thanks you get<br>
        All the thanks you get<br>
        It’s a raw deal, full-time gig<br>
        And you sure can’t raise em like your parents did<br>
        Otherwise they’ll just try and get rid—of you</p>
 
    <p>Well I went to school like folks said I should and I graduated in four years<br>
    and soon as I had received my diploma, they said, now find yourself some career<br>
    well I looked around and I couldn’t find nothing until one day, suddenly<br>
    I got a job hauling furniture for a moving company</p>
 
    <p>my first day there, they threw this party for a guy they all admired<br>
    said he’d been with the company forty years and was time for him to retire<br>
    course he was injured something terrible, he could barely keep up his head<br>
    but when he saw what he got for severance pay, this is what he said:</p>
 
    <p>That’s all the thanks I get<br>
        All the thanks I get?<br>
        broke my back, ruined my knees<br>
        paid all my own hospital fees<br>
        and that’s all the thanks I get?<br>
        All the thanks I get?<br>
        For all the time and effort I gave<br>
        Just to be treated like a slave<br>
        A one way ticket to an early grave—is my reward?</p>
 
    <p>Well I was walking by the recruiting office, with my thumb I was flippin a coin<br>
    A man was out there telling me that Uncle Sam wanted me to join<br>
    I said, “Join what?” and the recruiter said, “Why, buddy, that’s all up to you—”<br>
    Air Force, Navy, National Guard—long as it’s red, white, and blue,”</p>
 
    <p>Well I was about to sign up when all of a sudden another man comes up to me<br>
    He’s in a wheelchair and he’s got no legs and he’s wearing military fatigues<br>
    The recruiter told him to get lost, but the fella shouted out “Beware!”<br>
    He said, “I used to be just like you, now stead of legs all I got’s this chair—” </p>
 
    <p>And that’s all—the thanks you’ll get<br>
        That’s all—the thanks you’ll get <br>
        fight and kill just to stay alive <br>
        Make it home, you start to wish you had died <br>
        All—the thanks you’ll get<br>
        All—the thanks you’ll get<br>
        I’m a shell-shockd, manic-depressed<br>
        Got shards of shrapnel in my chest<br>
        Had nothing to start, now I got less—than that</p>
 
    <p>Well I was feeling sorta lost and a little confused about what I ought to do<br>
    Seems like everywhere I could think to go, there was some good reason not to <br>
    Friend of mine told me to seek some counsel, the counselor said, “Try church” <br>
    I said alright, I need help, I don’t see how that could hurt</p>
 
    <p>The preacher that Sunday was preachin a sermon bout this fella named Jesus Christ<br>
    Who helped the poor and healed the sick and never sinned in his whole life<br>
    Who taught humanity all the lessons it would ever need to learn<br>
    Who was betrayed, tortured, mocked, flogged and crucified in return</p>
 
    <p>And that’s all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        you see a problem and you try to be kind<br>
        people treat you like you’re out of your mind<br>
        all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        all the thanks you’ll get <br>
        you try to do a simple favor<br>
        lend a hand to your struggling neighbor<br>
        he don’t give you nothing for your labor—hell no—just a slap in the face     </p>

    <p>Some folks’ll tell you if you wanna be happy, havin a plan is the only way<br>
    You gotta get all your ducks in a row if you want those birds to lay<br>
    But my whole philosophy of life is, here today, then you’re gone<br>
    Might as well make the whole thing up right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>Well I went to see my fortune teller to learn about my destiny<br>
    She took ahold of both of my hands said, Well come here now, let me see<br>
    I asked her how she could tell my future just from lookin down at my palms<br>
    She winked and said, Honey, we’re just makin it up, right as we go along</p>
 
    <p>Well I got this one friend, he’s an actor, he works on the broadway stage<br>
    He’s the sorta fella can play any character of any gender, class or age<br>
    He says sometimes he’ll forget a line, but the show—it must go on<br>
    After that you’re just makin it up right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>I knew a man was a high-stakes gambler, he was a wizard at roulette<br>
    I watched him hustle a millionaire right out of the keys to a brand-new corvette<br>
    He said, you know you can’t guess right all the time, but it’s awful hard to be wrong<br>
    When you’re just makin the whole thing up, right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>I met a man could play the guitar better than anybody else I knew<br>
    Everything from jazz to swing to folk rock and the blues<br>
    He said I may not know all of the words ever written to every song<br>
    But it’s okay when you’re just makin it up right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>I got these friends, they live uptown, they make love look like such a sinch<br>
    They first met back when the war was on and they’ve been married ever since<br>
    I said, “With so many people getting divorced, how is it that you’ve stayed so strong?”<br>
    The said, Hell, we’ve just been makin it up right as we go along</p>
 
    <p>Well the Corinthians wrote to old saint paul about this problem that they had<br>
    It seems despite discovering Christianity, folks was still behaving bad<br>
    Paul wrote back and in so many words he said, “Keep calm—carry on—”<br>
    Like he was just makin the whole thing up right as he went along</p>
 
    <p>Lastnight I was watchin the old TV, and I caught some of the presidential debate<br>
    All these characters was up on stage for the audience to interrogate<br>
    Everytime anybody was accused of something, they’d deny it and say, “That’s wrong”<br>
    Just like they was just makin it up, right as they went along    </p>

    Don’t be mean, always be nice and kind<br>
    Keep your head up and do your best; make sure you get yourself plenty of rest<br>
    Be a leader, see that no one’s left behind<br>
    Chew your food, be polite, when it ain’t in use turn off the light<br>
    Don’t be late, be early, or at least be right on time<br>
    Wear a helmet, don’t get hurt, comb your hair, tuck in your shirt<br>
    Wait your turn—you’ll soon be next in line</p>
 
    <p>O but its hard to keep on grinning when everyone cept you is winnin<br>
        And everything feels like it’s spinning right down the toiletbowl’s mainstream<br>
        And even if you got that midas touch, time still turns everything to dust<br>
        Night to morning, dawn to dusk, gold to brass, steel to rust<br>
        No, nothing ain’t worth very much in the grand-scheme</p>
 
    <p>Mind your manners, mind your health, stand up straight, introduce yourself<br>
    Speak clearly, to the point, and don’t be shy<br>
    When in doubt just play it cool, keep out of trouble, stay in school<br>
    Wear your seatbelt when you drive or fly<br>
    Pay your taxes, pay your dues, pull up your pants, tie your shoes<br>
    On election day don’t forget to register and vote<br>
    Treat your neighbor as you would yourself, if you strike it rich well, share the wealth<br>
    We may have our differences, but we’re all in the same boat</p>
 
    <p>But it’s hard to keep on keepin when the liferaft’s long been leakin<br>
        And existence goes on eeking out getting more and more highstrung<br>
        And even if you got the Midas touch, time still turns everything to dust<br>
        Night to morning, dawn to dusk, gold to brass, steel to rust<br>
        No nothing ain’t worth very much in the long-run</p>
 
    <p>Don’t complain, don’t talk back, cite your sources, check your facts<br>
    If you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothing t’all<br>
    Check your tires, check your oil—bring that water to a boil<br>
    Keep your elbows up and your eye upon the ball<br>
    Always listen to your dad, pledge allegiance to the flag<br>
    Deck the halls with boughs fa la la la la la la la<br>
    Do the right thing when you can, smile for the camera man<br>
    You know the drill—blah, blah, blah, blah, blah</p>
 
    <p>But it’s hard to keep on servin when your master’s undeserving<br>
        And your loyalty’s been swerving like sparks off the main grindstone<br>
        And even if you got that Midas touch, time still turns everything to dust<br>
        Night to morning, dawn to dusk, gold to brass, steel to rust<br>
        All you get’s a “Thank You Very Much” etched on your headstone    </p>

    <h2>The Sneezing Song</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Maxims, Mantras & Moral Tales, 2021</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#maximsMantras_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Well let me tell you bout a friend I know / he sneezes everywhere he goes<br>
    He’s got the worst case of allergies as I’ve seen anywhere<br>
    Aside from pollen, dust, dirt, and grass / plastic, wood, metal, glass<br>
    He’s allergic to fresh water and fresh air<br>
    Most foods he cannot touch, just says, “No thank you, very much”<br>
    Can’t have gluten, corn or wheat or flax or whey<br>
    Dogs and cats he can’t go near and most people seem to give him fear<br>
    Cause most of our conversations go this way:<br>
        “Achoo! Achoo! Pardon me!” “Bless you!”<br>
        “Would you happen to have, by any chance, a—choo!”<br>
        “If you are gonna sneeze, for goodness sakes man, use your sleeve!<br>
        And may God bless you!” “Achoo!”</p>
 
    <p>Now the thing about this friend of mine is that he gets a little bit down sometimes<br>
    On account of cause he thinks that he is scorned<br>
    People always seem to think he’s sick, sneezing like a lunatic<br>
    But he says it’s just the way that he was born<br>
    That always seems to give me pause; I guess no one’s without his flaws<br>
    “Still” he says, “I wish it wasn’t so,”<br>
    I say, “Man, don’t let it get you down, you may not be the healthiest guy in town<br>
    But you’re more God-blessed than anyone else I know”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now thinkin about this friend I got always brings me round to another thought<br>
    Concerning what is wrong and what is right<br>
    Seems that some would try to attribute the instinct to bless a sneezing brute<br>
    To manners, saying that it’s just polite<br>
    Then they’ll go ahead and designate tween folks to love and folks to hate<br>
    And say that God’ll only bless a precious few<br>
    Now I don’t know that that’s the truth, I’ve heard it said but that sure ain’t proof<br>
    But if it is, well, God help me and you<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>I prefer to think that we’re all due for at least one blessing, if not two<br>
    That it hardly matters whether we’re first or last<br>
    If you need a reason just say because sneezing’s something everybody does<br>
    No exceptions, no exclusions, or outcasts<br>
    So God Bless You: whether lost or found, high or low or up or down<br>
    God bless you, whether chained or bound for home<br>
    God bless the mad, the meek, the mild, each complaining crying child<br>
    God bless the bastard and the orphan, all alone<br>
    God bless the scoundrels and the scabs, the beggars on corners dressed in rags<br>
    And every person that’s hard pressed to find a buck<br>
    God bless the hobo and the bum, the hitchhiker with his waving thumb<br>
    God bless the truckers who’ll stop to pick him up<br>
    God bless the guilty and the innocent, the 1 and the 99 percent<br>
    God bless the ones who don’t know which ones they are<br>
    God bless the hopeless and the poor, the gangster, thug, the pimp, the whore<br>
    God bless the man who holds the door ajar<br>
    God bless all the women and the men, and anybody that’s a blend<br>
    Who falls down somewhere in between the two<br>
    Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jew; God bless the atheists, too<br>
    They all sneeze, just like me and you—achoo!<br>
    God bless the captain and the cook, the storeowner and the crook<br>
    Everyone who doesn’t look like he’s supposed to<br>
    God bless the black, the white, the red, God bless the living and the dead<br>
    And everyone who’s ever said, “Achoo!”<br>
    God bless you, whether straight or gay, God bless the ones who swing both ways<br>
    God bless the ones who don’t have to pick a side<br>
    God bless the inmates on Death Row, the strong man in the circus show<br>
    God bless the bearded woman, who’s his bride<br>
    God bless the jesters and the clowns, God bless the addicts, falling down<br>
    God bless the ones who wear crowns of gold and thorns<br>
    God bless the pope, the priest, the nun; the fans who fill up the stadium<br>
    God bless the dirty devils and their horns<br>
    God bless the doctor and the nurse, the driver of the village hearse<br>
    The gardner and the man who digs the graves<br>
    God bless the nations, each and all, God bless the world that ain’t so small<br>
    And anyone else I might’ve forgot to say<br>
        Chorus    </p>

    <p>You can’t be a locksmith if you don’t got keys<br>
    You can’t be a beekeeper if you ain’t got bees<br>
    And you can’t be a doctor if you don’t get your degrees<br>
        It doesn’t matter what your parents say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t sound the alarm if there ain’t no bell<br>
    You can’t tell the story if there’s no story to tell<br>
    You can’t have your cake and eat it as well<br>
        It doesn’t matter what the billboards say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t take it easy if you’re takin it fast<br>
    You can’t use it up and expect it to last<br>
    You can’t see the future if you’re living in the past<br>
        It doesn’t matter what the calendars say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can shop for products from the comfort of your home<br>
        Hear all about the world outside on your mobile telephone<br>
        But you can’t really be a part of it if you’re always alone<br>
        No you can’t—no you can’t</p>
 
    <p>You can’t be a boxer if you can’t take a punch<br>
    You can’t solve no mystery if you got no hunch<br>
    You can’t expect me to work without a break for lunch<br>
        I don’t care what the bosses say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t tie a strong knot if you got weak rope<br>
    You can’t have lasting love without faith and hope<br>
    I’s in love with a woman, she’s married to some dope—<br>
        It don’t matter what your vows may say<br>
        You can’t always get it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t make a difference if you don’t go and try<br>
    You can’t fulfill demand if you got no supply<br>
    You can’t give people guns and expect no one to die</p>
 
    <p>You can’t pour a blind cup and not expect it to spill<br>
    You can’t withhold supply and expect demands to be filled<br>
    You can’t give people guns and expect no one to get killed<br>
        It doesn’t matter what the laws may say <br>
        You can’t always have it both ways<br>
        You can believe everything that you hear bout on the news<br>
        Believe that folks is evil cause it’s the life they choose<br>
    But you can’t never know a person til you’ve walked round in his shoes<br>
        No you can’t—no you can’t </p>
 
    <p>From where he’s been, you can’t tell where a man’s headin<br>
    From what he says you can’t tell at what he’s gettin<br>
    and you can’t be a rich man and get into heaven<br>
        It doesn’t matter what your paystubs say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t be sure if you sound so hesitant<br>
    You can’t remember seeing something that’s without precedent<br>
    You can’t be an idiot and run for president<br>
        Then again…lets see what the papers say<br>
        After all, this is the USA<br>
        Anybody can be king for just a day<br>
    Sometimes, I guess, you can have it both ways    </p>

    <p>I awoke—it was the Hour of Rest, I didn’t get any but I gave it my best<br>
    The telescreen cried, “What a beautiful day!” while outside my window all I saw was the gray<br>
    Smoke rising out of the fires below where sooner or later they tell me everyone goes<br>
    Whether you’re willing or unprepared, it doesn’t make a difference to the Man Upstairs</p>
 
    <p>I clocked in, took my place on the line, made the same old motion til it was quittin time<br>
    I got paid, went out on the town, drank a few free ones and bought a few rounds<br>
    It got late; I came home around one, got to thinking again how this has never been fun<br>
    Last thought I had before I dropped off to sleep was that if this is my life, then I’ve got to be</p>
 
    <p>On down—the road<br>
        Don’t look now but you got a long way to go</p>
 
    <p>They’re putting something in the water, it’s makin everyone smile; you don’t notice it until you’ve been without it awhile<br>
    And I’m sick now—I been puking my guts, but it’s a small price to pay to keep from goin nuts<br>
    Utopia: that’s the name of the Brand on every can, cup and bottle in the Fatherland<br>
    Where you’re free to be free, here, if only in dreams—so long as it doesn’t interrupt the machine</p>
 
    <p>I met the devil under an old willow tree—he didn’t look like such a bad fellow to me<br>
    He said, “Good and Evil: you know you cain’t always tell.  One man’s heaven is just another man’s hell—<br>
    Folks always ask me why I do what I done, I tell em it’s cause I got punished before I knew how come<br>
    They took my dignity, liberty, all that was mine; way I see it, I’m just making up for lost time—</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>In real life, there ain’t no progress at all; you get over the fence—you’re still facin a wall<br>
    your country’s the dirt underneath of your nails, your name’s just a word for when your history fails<br>
    and tomorrow, it will all be the same, the farmers will starve as they wait for the rain<br>
    the sword’s as corrupt as the soil it plowed, you can ask for permission, but you’re never allowed </p>
 
    <p>You want trouble? Here, let me give you my card—you live in a bubble and you think your life’s hard<br>
    You’re down on your knees and you’re trying to pray, but your prayers’ve been answered, 24 hours a day<br>
    We proved it; we got misery beat, you can’t argue with numbers, just rinse and repeat<br>
    Or else increase your dosage, take as much as you need; if nothing changes call me, if you need me, I’ll be—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I’m not lazy—I just like to rest<br>
    I’m not dirty—just not too clean, I guess<br>
    I’m not happy—but I’m doin my best<br>
        To play the hand that I been dealt<br>
    I ain’t quitting—I’m just on a break<br>
    I’m not guilty—I just made a small mistake<br>
    It’s not a setback, really—just a slight headache<br>
        It ain’t nothing that time won’t help </p>
 
    <p>But you know I haven’t come to tell you<br>
        What by now you must already know<br>
        There’s so little that has any value—<br>
        There’s only a few ways it could possibly go—</p>
 
    <p>I feel like my engine’s gone and lost a piston<br>
        Like I built a kingdom just to let it fall<br>
        You can’t resist once you’re inside the system—<br>
    And I’m just a little annoyed is all</p>
 
    <p>I’m not a cheapskate—I’m just moneywise<br>
    I’m not dishonest—I just prefer my old disguise<br>
    I’m not startled–I’m just kind of surprised<br>
        I didn’t know you were that kind of girl—<br>
    I ain’t cryin—it’s just raining out<br>
    I’m not hopeless—I’m just full of doubt<br>
    I don’t need you—I’d just prefer not to be without<br>
        Lord, it is a lonely world!</p>
 
    <p>but don’t let it go gettin your feathers ruffled<br>
        there’s really nothing else you could’ve done<br>
        the announcer’s voice coming through the mic was muffled<br>
        it could’ve happened to me or anyone—</p>
 
    <p>The lengths they’ve gone to see I’d be deprived—<br>
        Would almost make you think that my life weren’t small<br>
        But no one makes it out of this world alive<br>
        And I’m just a little annoyed is all— </p>
 
    <p>I’m not depressed—I just prefer to sing the blues<br>
    I’m not indecisive—I just don’t wanna haveta choose <br>
    I’m not complaining—I’m just looking to improve<br>
        This antiquated old machine<br>
    I ain’t weak—I’m just not that strong<br>
    We’re not incompatible—we just don’t really get along<br>
    It ain’t alright—don’t you get me wrong<br>
        I ain’t sayin it’s peachy-keen</p>
 
    <p>Sometimes I wish it would all go backwards<br>
        You’d begin at grief and move headlong into loss<br>
        You’d heal up as soon as you removed the daggers<br>
        you regain everything when you refund the cost— </p>
 
    <p>But without an ending, there ain’t no story<br>
        No happily ever after after all<br>
        The case is closed with the hanging jury<br>
        And I’m just a little annoyed is all—</p>
 
    <p>I’m not sick—I just don’t feel all that well<br>
    It’s not a secret—I just don’t really care to tell<br>
    I’m not withholdin—I just don’t have anything good to sell<br>
        or anything more to subtract—<br>
    I’m not crazy—I just haven’t found my groove <br>
    I’m not vindictive—I just don’t really like to lose<br>
    I’m not unjustified—I just don’t got no good excuse <br>
         Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
 
    <p>Won’t somebody give me some instruction<br>
        On whatever a man’s supposed to do? <br>
        I can’t seem to make any logical deduction<br>
        I can’t have my cake and eat it, too</p>
 
    <p>I feel like a powder keg what’s about to burst<br>
    Soon they’ll be scrapin me off the wall—<br>
    I’m surrounded by water and I’m dyin of thirst<br>
    And I’m just a little annoyed is all</p>
 
    <p>I’m not a hard case—I’m just difficult<br>
    I don’t intend it—you know that much yourself<br>
    I’m not in trouble—I just need a little bit of help<br>
        At some point, hell, don’t we all?<br>
    I’m not wrongheaded—I’m just incorrect<br>
    I’m not crazy—I’m just a little out of step <br>
    I’m not angry—I’m not even that upset<br>
        I’m just a little annoyed is all    </p>

    <p>I’d give up my ticket to travel first-class<br>
    Step out of my place in a long line, and be last<br>
    Tip my hat to the VIPs, and bid them aideu<br>
    As long as it meant that I could be—<br>

    <p>I’d compromise anything I claim to believe in<br>

    I’d welcome the chance for a new point of view<br>

    <p>I’d give up my dayjob tho it pays well and is easy<br>
    I’d come down off the mountain to live in the city<br>
    I’d share a crowded apartment on a loud avenue—<br>
    As long as it meant that I could be—<br>
        Close to you</p>
 
    <p>I’d pass up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity<br>
    disobey the wishes of my entire community<br>
    all kinds of trouble I’d get myself into<br>
    As long as it meant that I could be—<br>

    <p>If you were sick, I would risk the infection<br>
    If I knew you were wrong, I wouldn’t make no correction<br>

    <p>Corruption in the Whitehouse: headline ran in ‘72<br>
    When Nixon’s men broke in to the DNC HQ<br>
    If Deepthroat hadn’t telephoned his buddies, Carl and Bob<br>
    Nixon probably never would have turned over his job—so<br>
    Blow the whistle!—whistleblower, blow!<br>
    Let’s see you got a conscience that you ain’t afraid to show<br>
    Put your self-interest behind you, tell your bosses where to go—<br>
    the people have got the right to know</p>
 
    <p>Chelsea Manning was a soldier sent to Iraq on intel<br>
    Where civilians and enemies were bein indiscriminately killed<br>
    She had access to top secret files that were under lock-and-key<br>
    She put em on a website for all the world to see<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Well, all our data’s now the property of the US government<br>
    the NSA’s been getting it for years without consent<br>
    A man named Edward Snowden said “I’ve had enough of this!”<br>
    Sent what he knew discreetly to the international press<br>
    chorus</p>
 
    <p>Today we got old Donald Trump to keep us entertained<br>
    “Will you look into Joe Biden?” he asked the president of Ukraine<br>
    He would’ve been impeached when someone brought the news to light—<br>
    If a few Senate Republicans had the nerve to do what’s right!<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now some will say a whistleblower’s nothin but a liar<br>
    A stoolie turned a turncoat who knew he’d be getting fired <br>
    If you were in the same boat—tell me, what would you do? <br>
    And if you knew and kept it secret—well, what would that make you?<br>
    chorus</p>
 
    <p>I thank you, Mr. Snowden for all the risk you took—<br>
    And you, Ms. Chelsea Manning, you’re no traitor in my book<br>
    You face the blacklist, exile, prison, and you were slandered in the news<br>
    But I thank you for the sacrifice you’ve made to tell the truth<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>technology today is more advanced than it’s alleged<br>
    but it’s a tool that can be weaponized, a blade that’s double edged<br>
    the government says they spy on us to keep us all Red, White and Blue<br>
    But if you’re gonna keep your eyes on us, we’ll keep our eyes on you! <br>

    <h2>How Long (I'll Love You For)</h2>

    <p>Seasons change, climate, too<br>
    and people change—Lord knows I do<br>
    If impermanence is all that holds true<br>
    then what else can I hold onto?</p>
 
    <p>I’m sometimes right; I’m often wrong<br>
    We’ll know better further along<br>
    Your love is mighty, but how strong<br>
    You say you love me—yes—but for how long?</p>
 
    <p>Long as the seas meet land at shore<br>
    And earth pursues Her solar tour<br>
    long as this old heart endures—<br>
    That’s how long <br>
    That’s how long<br>
    That’s how long—I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>When I’m tired; when I’m wakeful<br>
    tho unworthy, not ungrateful;<br>
    year after year, may through april<br>
    long as you’re willing, I will be able</p>
 
    <p>long as there’s still room to grow<br>
        sky above and sea below<br>
        long as there’s time left to explore<br>
        that’s how long<br>
        that’s how long<br>
        that’s how long I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>Pick a number any one<br>
    Better yet, make it the highest one<br>
    Multiply it by ten billion<br>
    Throw in a few more—and then some</p>
 
    <p>As far as you can comprehend<br>
        And even further, after the end—<br>
        As long as there’s something still left in store<br>
        That’s how long<br>
        That’s how long<br>
        That’s how long I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>The day may come, I’ll be leavin<br>
    A few who knew me might hang round grieving<br>
    There’s a time for laughter and a time for weeping<br>
    And long as I’m standing, Long as I’m breathing</p>
 
    <p>As long as time withstands the clock<br>
        If it speeds up or if it stops—<br>
        Til kingdom’s come or come no more—<br>
        that’s how long I’m gonna love you for </p>
 
    <p>pick your poison, choose your pleasure<br>
    step by step, measure for measure<br>
    life is short, love’s forever<br>
    long as you’ll have me, then we’ll be together</p>
 
    <p>now and later, then, meanwhile<br>
        apart, together, single file <br>
        both and and and either or<br>
        that’s how long I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>love prefers the present tense<br>
    it receives more, the more it sends<br>
    its road goes on, around both bend<br>
    a lifelong journey that never ends</p>
 
    <p>(Repeat first chorus)<br>

    <h2>Work Harder (Get Paid the Same)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Poor Thing, 2022</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The factory whistle sounded at dawn, so we all gathered out on the floor<br>
    Foreman says, “You’re all doin so well, we thought you could do a little bit more—<br>
    He gave us our orders, said “Now I don’t want to hear anybody complain—”<br>
    You’ll be workin harder and harder, but you’re getting paid the same”</p>
 
    <p>The economy’s gone belly-up, business is following suit<br>
    Boss is keepin his salary, but he’s givin his workers the boot<br>
    Said, “Some’ll haveta be let go, for the rest of ya, all that’ll change<br>
    Is you’ll be working a little bit harder, but you’re gettin paid the same”</p>
 
    <p>Work harder—get paid the same!<br>
        It’s the company slogan—the name of the game!<br>
        It’s better than nothin! Don’t whine and complain!<br>
        You work harder—and you get paid the same! </p>
 
    <p>The cost of livin is on the rise and the landlord’s been raising the rent<br>
    Soon all the money you’ve set aside has gone the way the rest of it went<br>
    Tomorrow’s another workin day, a chance for to make and to gain<br>
    You’ll work a little bit harder, but you’ll be getting paid the same</p>
 
    <p>Society says do your best and there’s nothin you can’t achieve<br>
    You want to get rich quick in these times of ours—all you’ve got to do is believe!<br>
    I waited in line, put in my time, kept my head down, stayed in my lane<br>
    I worked harder and harder, but I just got paid the same</p>
 
    <p>Uncle Sam’s building an army, recruiting anyone he can find<br>
    He’ll tell you he’ll pay for your college if you just sign on the old dotted line<br>
    He’ll train you to hunt down and kill a man like he ain’t got a face or a name<br>
    You’ll work for him, harder and harder, and he’ll repay you just the same</p>
 
    <p>When I’s up I counted my blessings, when I’s down I looked to the Lord<br>
    I followed the rules to the letter—and I still ain’t received no reward<br>
    I’m no saint, by no means, Lord, to be humble, I’ve never claimed<br>
    But I’m workin harder and harder—and I’m getting paid the same</p>
 
    <p>History seems like a broken machine that spits out whatever’s put in<br>
    Despite how you’ve fought, your efforts have brought you to someplace you’ve already been<br>
    You can try a new course or keep beatin the dead horse as you pray for something to change<br>
    Feels like workin harder and harder just to keep getting paid the same</p>
 
    <p>I tried to break free of the eternity of running around on my wheel<br>
    I bought a guitar and I got in my car and went out to find something more real<br>
    I followed along and practiced the songs and by now I’ve learned the refrain:<br>
    It’s: work harder and harder and get paid the same</p>
 
    <p>Now the man upstairs is good and old, he’s been in charge for a while<br>
    To him it makes no difference if you owe him an inch or a mile<br>
    Whether your life’s been filled with privilege or if it’s been filled with pain<br>
    Righteous or wreckless, you get paid the same</p>
 
    <p>When I’m called I’ll rise and go—I won’t make any to-do<br>
    I prayed for things I needed bad, but my prayers just never got through<br>
    Naked and crying I’ll leave the world as naked and crying I came<br>
    I kept workin harder and harder—and kept getting paid the same    </p>

    <h2>I Didn't Even Stand a Chance</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Poor Thing, 2022</i> Track 7</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The ferris-wheel’s been crammed with likely suspects<br>
    the boardwalk’s lit up like it’s Christmas in July<br>
    there comes a time when a man must stand and face his prospects<br>
    with a keen, discerning and judicious eye <br>
    I came prepared, my equipment all was with me<br>
    I knew the odds would be against me in advance<br>
        But by the time I even knew what had gone and hit me—<br>
        It was too late—I didn’t even stand a chance </p>
 
    <p>I’ve tried to keep my eye out for any sign of danger<br>
    I didn’t want to be the victim of love’s charm<br>
    I’ve learned to be suspicious of every stranger<br>
    And I’ve been known to greet unexpected kindness with alarm<br>
        I hope that you don’t think I went and planned this <br>
        If there’s one thing I’d rather skip, well, it’s romance<br>
        But when I met you, I was already disadvantaged <br>
        It was too late—I didn’t even stand a chance—</p>
 
    <p>I’m well-practiced in the art of getting nowhere<br>
    I’ve rehearsed this scene a hundred thousand times<br>
    I know just what to say if you decide to go there<br>
    You’ll be on your way, and I’ll keep on mine—<br>
        But it would seem that habit’s failed me in this instance <br>
        I heard the music and got caught up in the dance— <br>
    I intended to give nothing but resistance<br>
        But it was too late—I didn’t even stand a chance </p>
 
    <p>You stood there looking far out at the ocean<br>
    Where the sky and water fused in a streak of blue<br>
    I’ve seen beauty that’s stirred my heart into commotion—<br>
    None of it could hold a candle up to you<br>
        I could feel the stealing-in of love’s intruders<br>
        My guard was let down, you had me drifting in a trance<br>
        Cupid must have raised an army of sharpshooters<br>
        outnumbered—I didn’t even stand a chance </p>
 
    <p>this must be what the bards and poets tell of<br>
    when they retire to their rooms to play and sing<br>
    and write their ballads all about their true-loves<br>
    what good’s it all—when sorrow’s all it brings?<br>
        I tried to put the feeling into language <br>
        My “Love at first sight” she destroyed with just a glance <br>
        Now the rapture and the joy’s turned into anguish<br>
        I should’ve known—I didn’t even stand a chance    </p>

    <p>Every place you go there’s folks there aiming to please—<br>
    The way you spend your money, it’s like it was growin on the trees<br>
    And even though you tell me that you didn’t come from royalty<br>
    Well, babe, you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>I’m not one to fall for that old vanishing act<br>
    I know just when the magician’s pullin a rabbit from his hat<br>
    I can usually sense when someone’s got something up her sleeve<br>
    But babe, you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>You got me where you want me, I’m too slow to dodge—<br>
        Just say the word and I’ll stay<br>
        I’m useful as a busted-up, broken down watch<br>
        Even a broken watch is still right—two times a day</p>
 
    <p>I ain’t one to believe every single thing I see<br>
    I don’t believe a word of what they tell me on TV<br>
    I ain’t one who’s known for his gullibility<br>
    But babe you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>They asked you for your effort, so you gave it your best try<br>
    When you folded from the pressure, they caught you in a lie<br>
    you couldn’t outfox the moral majority<br>
    But babe you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>I ain’t the sharpest knife in the set—<br>
        Is that how the expression even goes?<br>
        Feel like I’m looking for something I ain’t found yet<br>
        But every time I’m near you feels like I’m getting close—</p>
 
    <p>My mama warned me about women of your kind<br>
    She said don’t be chasing no one whose gonna make you wait your turn in line<br>
    Just goin by your looks, I could’ve swore you was heavenly<br>
    babe, you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>You know I’m getting older, I got water on the knee<br>
    You know that my eyes ain’t what they used to be—<br>
    You think you’re nothing special for anyone to see—<br>
    Well, babe, you could’ve shore fooled me    </p>

    <p>They’re saying by next year this land’ll be buried neath 35 feet of the sea<br>
    Those that can’t get out by liner or ferry will be sinking as sure as can be<br>
    Pharoah traded his army for a fleet of sleek vessels, if the seas part he’ll just run aground<br>
    Tell moses we’re sorry: salvation’s backordered—there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>Ma quit her job the day she delivered tho she took all six weeks of her leave<br>
    The breadcrumb of income in the end hardly differed, daycare costs more than you’d believe<br>
    And dad’s been out lookin for a job that’ll get him off the trail of them debt-collector hounds<br>
    Wherever he goes the employers all tell em, there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>Man on the sidewalk’s been asking for quarters from people who pretend he ain’t there<br>
    His cardboard sign reads: I’ll Have What You’re Having—Anything That You Can Spare<br>
    He says, “I been all through the towns of this country, small kindness is all that I’ve found<br>
    Loves all you need to get by in this life, and there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>You’d better wear waiters if you’re headed to Washington, I hear the bullshit there’s pretty deep<br>
    Power is one thing that people in power usually do their darndest to keep<br>
    They’re redrawing districts makin maps into mazes so that when voting day rolls around<br>
    The hopes’ll wear thin til the votes are all in and there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>The army recruiters are lookin for heroes to wave their American flag<br>
    They’ll send you abroad like they need you to be there til you get sent back home in a bag<br>
    A six-gun salute, an immaculate coffin, a white cross they’ll stake in the ground<br>
    The letter to mom says “your son was a patriot—wish there were more like him to go round.”</p>
 
    <p>They ask for our patience in the questing for justice, that holy of holymost grails<br>
    They ask us to trust their defunct machinery that history shows usually fails<br>
    The judge in his throne hasn’t even been listening—you’ll know when til the gavel comes down<br>
    They’re doling out justice like there’ll be no tomorrow—and there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>We’ve dug ourselves into a fine mess of trouble spending money that we never had<br>
    To buy things that wore out and made us unhappy which they told us would make us more glad<br>
    The poor get some—yes, but the rich get a tax-cut: and do you know why it’s called ‘trickledown’?<br>
    a trickle’s what happens before it shuts off completely leaving what ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>Time is a bastard and a thieving deceptor, a current you fight the whole way<br>
    Tomorrow eludes you while yesterday woos you meanwhile it’s always today<br>
    And life is a tale told by an idiot full up of fury and sound<br>
    You look for the meaning with the hourglass bleeding—there just ain’t enough to go round    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Dear country, I’m writing to tell you I’m fighting to come up with some single thing<br>
    To ignite or inspire the old poet’s desire, in me, of thee, to sing—<br>
    But no praise can I utter with my pride in the gutter as the national anthem gets sung<br>
    To a flag that looks dignified that always has signified: liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I’ve poured through the mystery of American history that was told from the conqueror’s view<br>
    That corrupted a heritage to respin a narrative about what white colonizers went through<br>
    Who committed a genocide, vanquished a countryside, which through outrageous violence was won<br>
    Executing hypocrisy in the name of democracy, with liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been stumbling and reeling as I grope for the feeling of freedom spelled out in the pomes<br>
    But what of the Apache, the Blackfoot, Comanche, the Africans, torn from their homes?<br>
    Your freedom’s to subjugate, enslave, kill, appropriate—when will we be free from<br>
    The powers that perpetrate, promote and perpetuate liberty and justice for some?</p>
 
    <p>they say here you’re free to do whatever you want to do—it’s true, long as you got the means<br>
    without any middle, most have less than little, while a few hoard an amount that’s obscene<br>
    and I don’t see an end to it when sixty percent of it will remain in the hands of just one<br>
    a condition arisen from capitalism, which lends liberty and justice to some</p>
 
    <p>At the borders they’ve ordered soldiers to bolster the walls they put up as defense<br>
    To stop immigration to an immigrant nation that’s composed of what it’s now against<br>
    Inventing solutions citing The Constitution to further qualify the word: “Everyone”<br>
    Giving no heeding to words or their meanings where there’s liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I turn on the TV most evenings all I see are tragedies broadcast as news<br>
    A white officer shooting a black man refusing to admit to what he didn’t do<br>
    in the grief and excitement the cries for indictment to the highest authority’s brung <br>
    which forgives law enforcement and displays the endorsement that there’s liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>The acts of our president are now without precedent, he’s made crimes that the Senate won’t try—<br>
    Proving by the hour that for people in power the rules just don’t seem to apply<br>
    Acting outrageously, speaking insensibly in tired corruptible tongues<br>
    Outlawing innocence to celebrate ignorance, with liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I stood in my vacuum at the back of the classroom, taking History over again<br>
    With the teacher insistin that everyone listen and kindly repeat after him:<br>
    “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the U—” hang on a minute—how come?<br>
    One nation, miserable, neath God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for some—    </p>

    <p>I can’t remember the words to this song<br>
    Wrote em down but didn’t bring em along<br>
    Now I’m confessin—I’m just guessin<br>
    I still got the tune, but the rest is gone—</p>
 
    <p>If I could remember just the first line<br>
    the second would be easy cause it probably rhymes<br>
    but it ain’t no use—I got no excuse—<br>
    And I must’ve played the thing a million times</p>
 
    <p>But I know the chorus goes like this:<br>
         —anyway, you get the gist<br>
        But this part right here, it’s in the bag—<br>
        Cause this song’s called the “Something Something Rag” </p>
 
    <p>I thought maybe if I just kept playing the song<br>
    The words’d come back—boy was I wrong!<br>
    I still got nothing—I’m just bluffing<br>
    Tune’s still here, but the rest’s still gone</p>
 
    <p>Here’s that chorus again<br>
        Somewhere we’ve already been<br>
        This is the worst luck I’ve ever had<br>
        I forgot the words to the something something rag</p>
 
    <p>Instrumental!<br>
 
    <p>Maybe you’re thinking: “Man, this guy sucks<br>
    Sure wish he’d get off the stage and shut up<br>
    What’s he doin?—who’s he foolin<br>
    He’s rehearsed it this way to make it sound made up—</p>
 
    <p>He’s playin the chorus one last time<br>
        To really drive home how hard he’s tryin<br>
        Someone should tell him that his song was bad— <br>

    <p>a cup of coffee still sits untouched<br>
    Right where I left it back there in the diner <br>
    Her message sounded like she’d been rushed<br>
    I thought I knew where I might find her<br>
    So I crossed several dozen mid-sized states<br>
    Along a road she had once named her shortcut<br>
    believing as I recalled her stubborn traits<br>
    that Love was one thing she’d never aim to forfeit<br>
    But my instinct’s slow—to overthrow<br>
        Any notion that the worst’s come true <br>
        any chance I’d take—if it’d help me make <br>
        My way back to you</p>
 
    <p>a soldier stopped me where the road dissolved<br>
    and showed me your portrait from the riot<br>
    he said, “She’s wanted—we think she’s somehow involved,”<br>
    I knew exactly what he meant by it;<br>
    So I followed the river to the shore<br>
    When I came to the sea, I went ahead and crossed it<br>
    The ferryman told me not to bother him no more<br>
    “If ever you ever had any luck with me, you’ve just gone and lost it”<br>
    Now I’m on the road—it’s getting cold<br>
        I’m inside out—I’m black and blue<br>
    I’m left behind—still trine to find<br>
        My way back to you</p>
 
    <p>The signs say one thing, but they mean something else<br>
    In the end it’s all somehow connected<br>
    If you want to get something done in this life, you’d better go and do it by yourself<br>
    But look out: it won’t be at all what you expected<br>
    The clues I’ll gather, the leads, exhaust<br>
    If there only were some way, I would quit hoping <br>
    All the crime scene tape reads: Do Not Cross<br>
    And when the gun turns up, it’s never smoking<br>
        I’m in a daze—unamazed  <br>
        feeling something not unlike deja vu<br>
        for goodness sake, I’m just trine to make <br>
        my way back to you</p>
 
    <p>BRIDGE:<br>
                I don’t need to know yet, I can wait and see—</p>
 
    <p>So I’ll wander down along the beaten path<br>
    I ain’t no pioneer, no trailblazer<br>
    You think I’m out for glory—hell, don’t make me laugh<br>
    I just wish I could reign in my own behavior<br>
    I’ll never give up, I’ll never cease to try—<br>
    I never did know how to surrender<br>
    They tell me beauty’s something exists in the beholder’s eye<br>
    But it feels like it’s her spell that I’m under—<br>
        It’s one more excuse—to win or lose <br>
        feel like my nine lives by now’s down to two<br>
        I’m in a pinch—just trying to inch<br>
        my way back to you</p>
 
    <p>in a different place, maybe, at another time<br>
    in the event of some extreme reversal<br>
    if it was you who had fallen, been stricken blind<br>
    and the story had made it round, full-circle<br>
    maybe if we’d checked it sooner from running completely wild<br>
    none of this ever would have happened—<br>
    I just wish you could be reconciled<br>
    Being that there’s nothing left for your subtraction<br>
        I’m in the gale—I’m on the trail<br>
        I’m almost done—I’m nearly through <br>
    I’m making time—still trine to find<br>
        My way back to you    </p>

    <p>6 a.m. and across the street the widow’s tearing out her flowerbed<br>
    Where there never have been roses and where nothing’s ever grown<br>
    You would almost think to see her there that it wasn’t all inside her head<br>
    You’d almost think she might just make it alright on her own<br>
        And lacing up your boots you think, “Absurd, absurd,”<br>
        As her child comes to wrap her in long sleeves<br>
        On the steps she holds her hand and you can just make out her words,<br>
        She says, “Mom, you’re the one who’s supposed to care for me…”<br>
            But you know how it is living in a small town <br>
            Where there’s only so much you can do<br>
            Where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            That anyone could ever love it much as you</p>
 
    <p>The line outside the bakery has all the usual customers<br>
    The milkman and the paperboy and the girl who runs the store<br>
    It’s February and it’s cold outside and the weather doesn’t feel too sure<br>
    One of them’s calling in to Mikee to come and open up his door<br>
        He steps out on the porch and says, “get off! Get off!”<br>
        Even as he gathers them inside<br>
        He pours them each a coffee and says, “You know I’ve had enough,” <br>
        And it doesn’t cost him nothing but his pride<br>
            But you know how it is living in a small town<br>
            Where somehow you came to be but not to stay<br>
            Where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            That they could all get on without you for one day</p>
 
    <p>Abraham’s a housepainter, he’s had cancer for a couple years<br>
    Lives alone inside a trailer in the woods behind the line<br>
    His wife divorced him long ago said she simply couldn’t stand the tears<br>
    That she had to leave him first if she would make it through his dying<br>
        Occasionally he stops in, says, “Hello, hello!”<br>
        When he’s feelin well she lets him see the kids<br>
        Every time she says it breaks her heart—each time he says he knows<br>
        He says, “We couldn’t know I’d make it like I did—”<br>
            But you know how it is living in a small town<br>
            Where you know each story and every name<br>
            Where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            That when you came back it’d still be just the same</p>
 
    <p>The town was never popular but it used to host a carnival<br>
    In the park between the firehouse and the church no one attends<br>
    the only famous person who ever lived here was a criminal<br>
    and he really wasn’t half as bad as everyone pretends<br>
        there’s a restaurant and a hotel and a bar, a bar<br>
        and all the roads lead to the river just behind the railroad track<br>
        and perhaps because I’ve heard it said, ‘True places never are’<br>
        my town, it is not down, on any map<br>
            but you know how it is, living in a small town<br>
            where it’s hard to dream of even feeling lost<br>
            where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            that that feeling even distance could exhaust    </p>

    <p>Jacob had himself about seven sons<br>
    And Joseph was his favorite one<br>
    And Joseph dreamed a simple dream<br>
    That the filthy ones would be made clean<br>
    that the empty ones would be made full<br>
    that the broken ones would again be whole;<br>
    Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen? Amen!</p>
 
    <p>When his brothers learned it was so<br>
    They all conspired to have him slo<br>
    One day they all went on a trip<br>
    They cast him down into a pit<br>
    Joseph didn’t put up much fight<br>
    But he never did quite lose his life<br>
    His life was spared and he was made a slave<br>
    He served Egyptians night and day<br>
    He served a man named Potiphar<br>
    The captain of the Pharaoh’s guard<br>
    He liked Joseph well—until one night<br>
    He walked in on Joseph with his wife<br>
    Potiphar had him thrown in jail<br>
    But the Lord was with him in the jail<br>
    Chorus</p>
 
    <p>And when the pharaoh dreamed a puzzling dream<br>
    He asked everybody, “What’s it mean?”<br>
    Joseph said, “I know what it means—”<br>
    And he explained the meaning of his dream<br>
    When the Pharaoh heard his dream described<br>
    He felt his eyes had been opened wide<br>
    And he brought him out and it was seen<br>
    That the filthy one had been made clean<br>
    That the empty one had been made full<br>
    That the broken one had been made whole<br>

    <p>Danny and Julia were dressed in their Sunday best<br>
    Though it was a Tuesday and already snowing<br>
    The cabbie who drove agreed to be their one wedding-guest<br>
    On the condition that they let him leave his meter going<br>
        The procedure was quick, the presider had seen to it<br>
        Some words of intent and the optional kiss<br>
        Life lay ahead, and he carried her into it<br>
        Down through the snow on the courthouse steps </p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where agreements are sanctified<br>
    promises notarized, futures foretold—<br>
    punishments doled out—arguments justified<br>
    slow gears rotated and fast ones pulled</p>
 
    <p>Frankie the Fist had seen plenty of things, I’m sure,<br>
    He’d worked for a gang that had moved contraband<br>
    One night, the police – raided their weapons store<br>
    Frankie got out with a slap on the hand—<br>
        The boss went to jail for holding and questioning<br>
        When the trial date came, Frankie showed with the Feds <br>
        There was the sound of a gun, unmistakable, deafening—<br>
        and Frankie fell dead on the courthouse steps </p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where what goes around comes around<br>
    Where you’re made to speak up while you’re fighting to breathe <br>
    Where a man can be beat and kicked when he’s fallen down<br>
    And Lady Luck’s always got one more card up her sleeve</p>
 
    <p>John Henry’s case had unfortunate precedence:<br>
    A black man accused of a white homicide<br>
    the all-white jury was presented with evidence<br>
    it took them all of about ten minutes to decide—<br>
    A TV news crew sent to report on it<br>
        Caught the moment the defense began the protest:<br>
        crying: “If justice ain’t served in the halls that were built for it—<br>
        Then let it be done on the courthouse steps!”</p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where the shadow of justice falls<br>
        On weeping and wailing and the gnashing of teeth<br>
        On the eyes of the pained, their backs up against the walls<br>
        Their hearts more inflamed by Time and by Grief</p>
 
    <p>Oil & Coal were the wealthiest trades, by far—<br>
    Til the disposal of waste caused the profits to tank<br>
    Sure, they took on some risk making trips to the reservoir<br>
    til it all trickled back to the water they drank—<br>
        First people got sick, and then they began to die<br>
        And slowly the pieces began to connect—<br>
        By the time of the trial, thousands agreed to testify, <br>
        The whole town in line on the courthouse steps</p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where the end of the tale is set<br>
    Where eventually all of the odds become even<br>
    The defense lawyer yawns and puts out his cigarette<br>
    Sayin a prayer to the God he can’t bring himself to believe in</p>
 
    <p>John Fontleroy was arrested for battery<br>
    He’d been charged years before with killing his wife<br>
    The Not Guilty verdict came from some technicality <br>
    About how they’d never been able to turn up the knife—<br>
        But now there was proof; and he was in custody<br>
        He called his lawyer to tell him he was under arrest<br>
        His lawyer just laughed and said “Man, double jeopardy—<br>
    You’ll be free fore you get to the courthouse steps.”</p>
 
    <p>The courthouse steps—where fortunes are overturned<br>
    Where right and wrong change with a roll of the dice<br>
    Where the innocent—can be tied to the stake and burned—<br>
    But you can’t charge the guilty for the same crime twice</p>
 
    <p>Danny and Julia, dressed in their Sunday best<br>
    With two kids between them, and their lawyers beside<br>
    The divorce was prepared, but there was still all the rest—<br>
    the house, finances, custody to decide<br>
        The procedure cost more than either one could afford to pay<br>
        But they still hadn’t reached any agreement yet— <br>
        And so they emerged—each going their separate way, <br>
    Down through the snow on the courthouse steps     </p>

    <p>It was me and Parker’d been assigned the case<br>
    By lieutenant Flood, without a trail to chase<br>
    The thing was messy, so said the Sarge<br>
    A child missing, thieves at large—<br>
    It was your classic ransom, a demand to trade<br>
    The victims wealthy and so they could’ve paid <br>
    But to fool the bandits, the parents had tried<br>
    And so now the ‘Missing Person’ was a ‘Homicide’<br>
        Sarge looked at Flood and Flood met my eyes<br>
    Said, ‘I hope discretion you can exercise—'<br>
    ‘If a man can’t do,’ said Parker, ‘what his bosses ask—<br>
        He ain’t fit to wear no gun and badge’</p>
 
    <p>The grieving father, in a vengeful state<br>
    Hired on some outside associate<br>
    Nobody talkin saw what all went down<br>
    At that farm-house hide-out on the edge of town<br>
    Six men with escorts, all of them inside<br>
    When the building burned down, none survived—<br>
    One of the victims was Ms. Velma Pearl<br>
    And we soon found out she’d been Sarge’s girl—<br>
        So we went to Sarge with our discovery—<br>
        He dismissed us sayin  ‘bring your report to me—<br>
        If he goes to pieces when he’s feelin torn—<br>
    That man ain’t fit to wear this uniform’</p>
 
    <p>So it was me drove Parker along the killer’s route<br>
    to ask a few more question, see what we could find out<br>
    Up Dead Man’s Hill, as we approached the crest<br>
    Parker took two bullets—through the head and chest<br>
    And later that night—down in Evidence<br>
    Flood returned a rifle, and his innocence—<br>
    He never signed it, in or out, of course<br>
    But the bullets matched the ones in Parker’s corpse—<br>
        And I know he’ll say it when he takes the stand<br>
        He’ll tell you all about the chain of command<br>
        How if a man can’t do what his bosses ask:<br>
        That man ain’t fit to wear no gun and badge’</p>
 
    <p>When you’re in the precinct, it’s like the corps<br>
    There’s a code of honor, an oath that’s swore<br>
    I asked the Sarge once about his divorce<br>
    He said ‘cop’s true love is always The Force’<br>
    When you’re on the force, the command’s a chain <br>
    And that’s the meaning behind everything<br>
    It’s all for one and one for all<br>
    Until your in trouble, then it’s “lowest takes the fall”<br>
        And I took an oath to protect and serve<br>
    But not men like these, that you can be sure of—<br>
        And if he can’t do right—or tell the truth when asked—<br>
        He shouldn’t wear no gun and badge    </p>

    <p>In the days when the world was young and raw<br>
    There lived a man who was without flaw<br>
    ten kids, a wife, for family<br>
    crops, livestock and property—<br>
    he was unselfish and didn’t hoard<br>
    both night and day he thanked the Lord<br>
    and abundantly, his gladness flowed<br>
    they said there’d never been a man like Job—<br>
        Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen? Amen!</p>
 
    <p>In those days the devil was like most men<br>
    One day the Lord called unto him:<br>
    He said, “Satan, as you’ve roamed the road—<br>
    Have you ever seen a man like Job?<br>
    Whose gratefulness cannot be quelled<br>
    Whose faithfulness is unparalleled<br>
    Whose humanness is such quality—<br>
    Who night and day, worships me<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Devil said, “He’s something—but he ain’t much—<br>
    You gave that fella the Midas touch<br>
    Go ahead and put him to the test<br>
    You’ll see he’s just like all the rest.<br>
    Deprive him, lay his life to waste—<br>
    You’ll see him curse you to your face.<br>
    There’s a side to Job you’ve never met<br>
    How much do you wanna bet?”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>So Job stood in his field one day<br>
    When a messenger arrived to say:<br>
    “We were beset by enemy swords <br>
    They took your horses, killed your herds…”<br>
    And as he spoke, another came:<br>
    “They’ve killed your men, Job, burned your grain…”<br>
    And as that one spoke, a third arrived<br>
    “Your sons and daughters all have died,”<br>
    Their stories ended all the same<br>
    With the morbid, mournful, sad, refrain:<br>
    “You’ve been deprived, you are bereft<br>
    To tell the tale I’m all that’s left—”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>In light of all this news his faith<br>
    amazingly remained in place<br>
    The man they said had been unflawed<br>
    Lost everything and prayed to God<br>
    And for seven days he did not eat<br>
    And for seven nights he did not sleep<br>
    Except for this he barely spoke<br>
    “What the Lord provides He may revoke” <br>
    He tore his clothes and shaved his head<br>
    When he finished prayin, this is what he said:<br>

    <p>Last night it was fair game / drinkin whiskey and champagne<br>
    Somebody offered me cocaine / in a bathroom stall<br>
    But this morning I’m reeling / my head’s split and I’m feeling<br>
    Like too much of a good thing / ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>I drank from the flagon / I went chasing dragon<br>
    You know it took the whole gallon for a buzz that felt small<br>
    Damn right I’m complaining, it’s just myself that I’m blaming—<br>
    Too much of a good thing ain’t no good at all</p>
 
    <p>The game was amazing / I mean the cards I was playing<br>
    They went all in and I raised em / it was just too good to call<br>
    I won the motherload payout / then got robbed on my way out<br>
    yeah too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>from a toxic envir’n’ment / you were beauty incarnate<br>
    in your second-hand garment / and some kind of a shawl<br>
    what did you have against me that you had to convince me<br>
    that too much of a good thing ain’t no good at all?</p>
 
    <p>Dawn broke to acknowledge that the room was demolished<br>
    The brass had lost all its polish and there was a hole in the wall<br>
    I tried bein honest, but no good deed goes unpunished—<br>
    Too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>No doubt it’s recorded how my risks were rewarded<br>
    How the plans that I thwarted did abhor and appall—<br>
    it’s like my mama done taught me / fore the sheriff done caught me<br>
    she said too much of a good thing ain’t no good at all</p>
 
    <p>I’ve savored and lavished, refrained from and ravished,<br>
    I’ve evenly averaged, on the whole, overall—<br>
    but obeying the treaty only profits the greedy <br>
    too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been out to lunches with the generals and judges<br>
    I’ve rolled with the punches of bureaucracy’s brawl<br>
    They claim that their shutting / of doors is a good thing<br>
    well, too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>You fast and you famish, resist all you can manage<br>
    Your desires you banish like the ice from a thaw<br>
    Until one day you grow up and you gorge til you throw up<br>
    And learn too much of a good thing / ain’t no damn good at all    </p>

    <p>Daddy sent a card at Christmas sayin he’s sorry he couldn’t make it home<br>
    Mama had to borrow money from the neighbor just to make a supper from the butcher’s bone<br>
    That year we didn’t get no stockings—but the schools were closed on account of snow<br>
    I remember mama sitting us all down and sayin, “Presents ain’t always store-bought things you know—<br>
        It’s sometimes when you feel like cryin that you oughtta thank your lucky star<br>
        With this world bein the way it is—and these times bein what they are </p>
 
    <p>I come from Pennsylvania, a steel town they call Bethlehem<br>
    The stacks ain’t fired since ‘03—and now there’s casinos right on top of them<br>
    I’ve since lived in other places—a few of them have felt like home<br>
    But I never seem to stick round too long—there’s just too much of this damn world to roam<br>
        If there’s a place and y’all’re going, I’ll take the last seat in that car<br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times bein what they are</p>
 
    <p>As soon as I got out of high school, I went off to college and took on debt<br>
    In hindsight the diploma ain’t done much for me and the loans still aren’t paid off yet<br>
    Someday I’ll be retirement ready but Lord knows I won’t have a dime to show<br>
    Cause healthcare costs what retirement used to and social security’s goin the way of the buffalo—<br>
    Boom or bust or desperation—any I’d say would be right on par <br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times being what they are</p>
 
    <p>I met a girl way out of my own league, I knew it couldn’t ever last too long<br>
    It was the first time I ever fell in love with someone, it was the first and only time that I wasn’t wrong—<br>
    She said, ‘Sam, you know what your whole hang-up is? You’re about as broken as the worst I’ve seen<br>
    You pretend to be living on the up-and-up, but really you’re just living on the in-between<br>
        When she left she said, “You ought to thank me—it’s not everyone would let you keep those scars<br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times being what they are—" </p>
 
    <p>I went in person to the factory to inquire after one of them jobs<br>
    Foreman said they weren’t hiring—matter of fact, they were getting ready to lay some people off<br>
    So I turned and started walkin, half-way home I stopped to wet my beak<br>
    Bartender said I looked like I’d just stepped in from a years-long losing streak <br>
        He poured a beer, slid it to me, said “Your money’s no good at my bar— <br>
        With this world bein the way it is and these times being what they are—”</p>
 
    <p>TV says there’s been another mass shooting—the politicians have nothin to say<br>
    They act like they can’t do anything about it, but they keep taking contributions from the NRA<br>
    And the worse it gets the more I’m certain that calling for the police just ain’t right—<br>
    If the violence of the civilian world don’t kill you, police brutality always might<br>
    You can sit by and say it ain’t your problem, but one of these days you’re gonna be forced to spar<br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times being what they are—</p>
 
    <p>When most folks are in debt and struggling because 1% hold most of a nation’s wealth<br>
    And there’s still the mindset that drugs is criminal rather than a matter of public health<br>
    The prison cells are overflowing with folks whose crimes don’t begin to compare<br>
    to the double-dealing, power-abusing two-faced legislators who put them there<br>
        But nothing comes as too surprising, the absurd don’t even feel bizarre<br>
        With this world bein the way it is and these times bein what they are</p>
 
    <p>The forests are all catching fire, mother nature’s been keepin score<br>
    Pollution is just the air we’re breathin from San Francisco to the Jersey Shore<br>
    Planet Earth is on its last legs, it’s resources will all be used up soon<br>
    Instead of working to develop sustainable solutions, scientists are seein bout building colonies on the moon<br>
        I spose I should be singing – Ain’t we lucky to have got this far?<br>
        With this world bein the way it is and these times bein what they are    </p>

    <h2>Stack Lee Shelton's John B. Stetson Hat</h2>

    <p>It was late Christmas evening somewhere in missori</br>
    Billy lyons was shot by mean old stack-o-lee</br>
    Some say it was cause he owed that man a debt</br>
    But the rest of us know it was much simpler than that</p>
    
    <p>Just ask William Curtis, he was tendin bar that night</br>
    He knew exactly who had started the whole fight</br>
    He said, Bill came in smiling, gave old stack a friendly pat</br>
    Then the fool goes and tries on his John B. Stetson hat</p>
    
    <p>Why’d anybody go and do a crazy thing that?</br>		 
    As to try on stack lee shelton’s john B Stetson hat?</p> 
    
    <p>The newsman he came running when he heard about Bill’s death</br>
    he bursts in Willy’s bar room with his pencil, out of breath,</br>
    “When? Where? What happened?  How’d he do it? What for? Why?”</br>
    Stack Lee’s still sittin there with his smoking .45</p>
    
    <p>Stack says, “Go ask Deliah, she was sittin right there at the bar</br>
    Go and ask her, she can tell you everything she saw”</br>
    She says, “Well, Bill came in, said, ‘This seat taken?’ then he sat,</br>
    Then that fool tried on Stack Lee’s John B. Stetson hat.”</p>
    
    <p>Chorus</p>
    
    <p>well someone called the police and they all got there in good time</br>
    Stack Lee hadn’t moved one step from the scene of the crime</br>
    Commissioner walks straight up to Stack says, “You care to tell me who</br>
    That is lyin dead on the floor, whose blood’s all over you?”</p>
    
    <p>By the time Ms. Lyons gets there with her children all in tow</br>
    Its just in time to hear the commissioner say, “Well, boys, we’ve gotta let him go,</br>
    it’s a shame for billy lyons that stack lee Shelton shot him through</br>
    But if he’d a touched my john b Stetson, I’d’ve probably shot him, too.”</p>
    
    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>next day in the paper the story’s written plain to read</br>
    bout the death of billy lyons at the hand of stack-o-lee</br>
    the article concludes, calls the killin “justified”</br>
    says it isn’t very likely that Mr. Shelton will be tried</p> 
    
    <p>but he did stand trial eventually, so there wouldn’t be no doubt</br>
    it lasted all of fifteen minutes fore judge Hanson threw it out</br>
    when he heard that Billy Lyons took Stack’s hat from off his crown</br>
    he said, “This case is over,” and he brought his gavel down</p>

    <p>chorus</p>

    <p>They gave the orders in Washington, D.C., it was there the decision got made:</br>
    the US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, went and overturned Roe v. Wade</p>
    
    <p>now all you ladies better take warning, cause here's what the decision meant:</br> 
    that the female body is now officially the property of the US government</p>
    
    <p>they've left it open to interpretation, so it'll vary every place you go</br>
    but it's already illegal to get an abortion in Oklahoma and in Idaho</p>
    
    <p>Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Wisconsin--Arkansas and Missouri,</br> 
    South Dakota, Texas, ole West Virginia--Louisiana and don't forget Tennessee</p>
    
    <p>so if you get pregnant you'll have to deliver, no matter if by mistake</br>
    in the eyes of the state it don't make no difference if you consented or got gang raped</p>
    
    <p>it means one more physician will be off to the slammer for doing as his patient wished</br>
    it means one more anonymous Jane Doe baby for the annual adoption list</p>
    
    <p>or else it's one more body gone to the coroner with a note writ in the doctor's scrawl</br>
    here lies a patient whose cause of dying was: "No good reason at all."</p>
    
    <p>and all you who point to the scripture for evidence, and would count every death a sin</br>
    why don't you use your pro-life agenda to stop the next state-sanctioned execution?</p>
    
    <p>consider your preachers, your pastors, your prophets--your husbands who want you to forget--</br>
    That Jesus was born between God and a woman--man had nothing to do with it.</p>
    
    <p>The Republicans say that they favor America, and aim to make it Great Again!</br>
    They use familiar words like liberty and freedom, but spell em: 'F-A-S-C-I-S-M'</p>
    
    <p>and how can you say that you're standing for freedom, when it's freedom that you plainly refuse?</br>
    when you stand in support of the Supreme Court's decision to deny a woman's right to choose?</p>

    <p>A man named William Bezos took his gal to see a play</br>
    And on the journey homeward they stopped into a café</br>
    As soon as they were seated Liza grabbed the bill of fare</br>
    She looked the menu over, ordered everything was there</p>

    <p>Bill says, “I know you’re hungry gal, and I don’t like to squeal—</br>
    But who do you suppose is going to pay for such a meal?</br>
    You may have known me purty long, but you sure have got my first name wrong</br>
    My name is Bezos but it ain’t Jeffrey—</p>

    <p>My name is Bezos but it ain’t Jeffrey</br>
        There is no dot-com empire that belongs to me</br>
        You may have known me purty long but you sure have got my first name wrong</br>
        My name is Bezos but it ain’t Jeffery</p>

    <p>Bill Bezos married Liza thinking he could change her ways</br>
    But what she did to William’s purse I’m most ashamed to say</br>
    Whenever she’d go shopping she’d buy everything she’d see</br>
    And what she couldn’t pay for, had sent home, C.O.D.</p>

    <p>One day six big delivery wagons backed up to bill’s door</br>
    They asked him to accept the goods while they went back for more</br>
    It didn’t take bill very long to grab his hat and coat</br>
    When Liza came home that night, she found this little note:</p>

    <p>Well the east coast had me feelin like I had no room to grow</br>
    So I packed up everything I owned, came to Boise, Idaho</br>
    I’s lookin for a home—I’s lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Well as soon as I got to Boise, I got held up at the gate</br>
    Highway’s jammed with fancy cars with California plates</br>
    Lookin for a home—lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Next day I found me a lender and told him I hoped to buy</br>
    He laughed at my finances, said, “I guess you can try—”</br>
    Lookin for a home—lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Well the first house that we went to, we had to stand in line</br>
    By the time we made it to the door they were takin down the “For Sale” sign</br>
    That house got sold—that house got sold</p>

    <p>She took me to another one that I thought looked pretty nice</br>
    They asked for twice what it appraised for, it sold for double the askin-price</br>
    Looking for a home—still lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Well I finally put in an offer but it just weren’t no match</br>
    For that Seattle Do-Re-Mi and the San Fransisco cash</br>
    I get out-bid—I get out-bid</p>

    <p>Well the owners have it easy; all the buyers missed the boat</br>
    There’s people out here ready to slash each other’s throats—</br>
    Lookin for a home—looking for a home</p>

    <p>Now they say it’s a seller’s market, which means the seller can be bought</br>
    But not before he’s cleaned you out and taken all you got</br>
    You’re lookin for a home—you need a bigger loan!</p>

    <p>Well I wish someone had told me—I wished that I had known</br>
    I moved from Philadelphia to Boise just to live in Mountain Home</br>
    Mountain Home—that’ll be my home!</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#updatesReprises&Ripoffs_album">Back to Album</a></h4>

    <p>There is a man you’ll hear some about</br>
    never had much fortune or fame—</br>
    But he lived and died a hero to some</br>
    Dietrich Bonhoffer was his name</br>
    Dietrich Bonhoffer was his name</p>
    
    <p>Born and raised on German soil</br>
    At the turn of the century</br>
    He studied hard at the Berlin College</br>
    Got himself a theology degree</br>
    Got himself a theology degree</p>
    
    <p>He preached the gospel of the poor</br>
    To all them that wasn’t free</br>
    When Adolf Hitler came to power</br>
    He said, “Friends this ain’t how it should be—”</br>
    My friends, this ain’t how it should be</p> 
    
    <p>Bonhoffer joined the ranks of them</br>
    who spoke out against the Nazi scum</br>
    and even though he was a pacifist</br>
    he said, “About this Hitler, something must be done!”</br>
    About this Hitler, something must be done!”</p>
    
    <p>He was silenced on the radio</br>
    He was silenced in the lecture hall</br>
    The Nazis gave him a pretty hard time—</br>
    He couldn’t hardly get no work at all</br>
    Couldn’t hardly get no work at all</p>
    
    <p>When his anti-Nazi views got known</br>
    His friends begged him to come away</br>
    They told him, “It ain’t safe for none but Nazis over there,”</br>
    He said, “That’s why I’m a gonna stay— </br>
    That’s exactly why I’ve gotta stay”</p>
    
    <p>He joined a resistance movement underground</br>
    Where he got sworn to secrecy</br>
    They made a plot to take Hitler down</br>
    They called it operation valkerie</br>
    They called it operation valkerie</p>
    
    <p>They put a bomb in an old briefcase</br>
    and got it planted in a meeting room</br>
    when Hitler sat down with his generals to talk</br>
    that briefcase went ker-boom—!</br>
    that briefcase went kaboom—!</p>
    
    <p>The explosion killed a man or two</br>
    But the attempt to murder Hitler failed</br>
    when he found out who had put the briefcase there</br>
    They threw Bonhoffer in jail</br>
    The Nazis threw bonhoffer in a jail</p>
    
    <p>And there he sat for a year and a half</br>
    Writing letters and sermons to his Lord</br>
    All the while praying his endless prayer</br>
    To bring an ending to this awful war</br>
    To bring an ending to this awful war</p>
    
    <p>He wrote, “the question aint how can I escape this mess</br>
    and still keep my own conscience clean?</br>
    the question is how will life endure—</br>
    if we stand by and don’t do anything?</br>
    If we all stand by and don’t do anything?”</p>
    
    <p>The execution orders finally came down—</br>
    April 8 of 1945</br>
    The very next morning at dawn’s first light</br>
    They hung bonhoffer til he died</br>
    They hung dietrich bonhoffer til he died</p>
    
    <p>Some people say he could’ve made it out</br>
    If he had given up or surrendered or lied</br>
    And some say that all he ever did was fail—</br>
    But at least old bonhoffer tried</br>
    At least deitrich bonhoffer tried</p>
    
    <p>Wherever there’s evil men takin power</br>
    And people see it but just don’t care</br>
    Wherever there’s a country getting less free by the hour</br>
    the ghost of bonhoffer’s goin there</br>
    the ghost of bonhoffer’s goin there</p>

    Bout a new kind of virus, Corona’s the name</br>
    From China to Europe to the US of A—</br>
    This is what all of the people there say:</p>
        
    <p>So long, it’s been good to know ya</br>
        So long, it’s been good to know  ya</br>
        So long, it’s been good to know ya</br>
        This coronavirus has me sittin at home</br>
        Wishin I weren’t all alone </p>
    
    <p>to contain the disease the lawmakers implore</br> 
    no crowds shall consist of a hundred or more</br>
    they’re cancellin festivals, concerts, parades</br>
    as for weddings and funerals—they’ll just have to wait</p>

    <p>chorus</p> 
    
    <p>they’ve locked up the restaurants and they’re closing the stores</br>
    most places of businesses are shutting their doors</br>
    it’s stopped the economy dead in its tracks</br>
    if you can’t work from home, they’ll give you the axe—sayin</p>

    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>if you’re in education, they say you’ll be fine</br>
    colleges are movin everything to online</br>
    so you can still take your classes and do your workload</br>
    long as the internet servers don’t collapse or explode</p>
    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>the doctors will tell you to keep your hands clean</br>

    <p>With every new death, there’s an increase of sorrow</br> 
    5 gone today, will be 500 tomorrow</br>
    No telling how many we’ll lose fore the end</br>
    They say it’s not a matter of “if” but of “when”—</p>
    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>The CDC says they couldn’t rehearse</br>
    And before it gets better it’ll have to get worse</br>
    We saw the thing coming but we couldn’t prepare</br>
    So our advice to you now is to just say your prayers—</p>

    <p>now I’m sitting at home in my self-quarantine</br>
    doin my best to practice social distancing</br>

    <p>Went to prison cause I couldn’t pay a lousy fine</br>
    Put me away so long I lost track of the time—</br>
    January first it was ten below,</br>
    They set me loose without a place to go</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I tried the shelters, but they didn’t have any beds</br>
    So I asked if there were somewhere I could go instead?</br>
    They said if you need to keep warm and dry</br>
    Give the subway platform a try—</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I wanted work but I didn’t have a state ID</br>
    So I paid a little visit to the PA DMV</br>
    I took a number and I got in line</br>
    I’s still waiting at the closing time—</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>Next day I went back down there very first thing</br>
    They sent me away, said, When you come back be sure and bring:</br>
    Proof of address and proof of birth</br>
    And 30.50, and that’s all I’m worth </br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I also needed my social security card</br>
    Trine to get it without ID’s nothing short of hard</br>
    Try to get it and they’ll tell you, brother—</br>
    You need the one to get the other</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>If I land a job, the minimum is all it pays</br>
    All it promises is an annual fifty-cent raise</br>
    I’ll be working full plus overtime</br>
    Rent’s still late and I’ll still get fined</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I can’t keep track of the hours anymore</br>
    I’m at work sixteen of every twenty-four</br>
    Plain exhausted, can’t get no rest</br>
    Nough to make even a hopeful man depressed</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I’ve been living tween a hard place and a rock</br>
    My life’s just one long race against the clock</br>
    Soon as I can get a little bit of slack</br>
    Take one step forward and two steps back</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>Everywhere you turn folks is struggling to get by</br>
    the only way to get enough is to fight or die—</br>
    You wanna know where all the money went</br>
    check the pockets of the one percent</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>Donald Trump has shut the government down</br>
    And empty is the head that wears the crown</br>
    Now my foodstamps won’t come in</br>
    Til the government’s up and running again—</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I’m sick as a dog, but I still ain’t insured</br>
    Poverty’s an illness and I don’t know if I can be cured</br>
    Every time that I get tripped up</br>
    There ain’t nobody there to help me up</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I needed money and I needed money fast</br>
    I had debts to pay and my deadlines all were past</br>
    I’d be alright but for one big flaw:</br>
    I can’t make a dollar short of breaking the law</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I’ve heard the tales that Jesus Christ was poor</br>
    He lived hand-to-mouth while goin door-to-door	</br>
    How come every door I try and knock</br>
    Leads me right back around to the cops?</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Updates, Reprises & Ripoffs, 2024</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#updatesReprises&Ripoffs_album">Back to Album</a></h4>

    <p>I was feeling sad and small and scared</br>
    a National Emergency had been declared</br>
    took a dose of Fox News for my breakfast</br>
    headed down to southern texas</br>
        aiming to defend my country—</br>
    against the impending immigrant threat!</p>

    <p>Well I got down there expecting to meet my enemy</br>
    But there’s just desert far as the eye could see</br>
    then I felt a gunbarrel poking at my spine</br>
    I turned around saw it was a man with skin like mine</br>
        He said, “Darn!  I thought you was one of them! </br>
    Damn if I didn’t just about shoot you dead!”</p>
    
    <p>Well he laughs it off and turns me loose</br>
    When a parade of people comes marching through</br>
    Looked like a band of redneck soldiers</br>
    Had picks and trowels flung over their shoulders</br>
        I said is it them? </br>
    The immigrant threat?</p> 

    <p>The fella says, “No—that ain’t them at all—</br>
    They’re friends—come to help build Trump’s wall!”</br>
    I asked him what he was talkin about</br>
    Said, “It’s Trump’s plan to keep the immigrants out</br>
        Build a wall—</br>
        You know, like a big one!</p>

        <p>He says, “I was born in the good old USA</br>
    That’s more than them immigrants can say</br>
    Even though my ancestors came on a boat</br>
    And robbed and pillaged the native folks</br>
        And enslaved the Africans—</br>
        We still been here long enough to know it’s ours!</p>

        <p>Says “we’ll build a wall that’s thick and strong</br>
    It’ll be half a million miles long</br>
    Like the Great Wall of China or of old Berlin</br>
    It’ll keep foreigners out and us safe within</br>
        Kind of like a prison—but for our freedom!</br>
        And all the stories we tell ourselves!</p>

        <p>I’s beginning to see what kind of plan it was</br>
    But he went on, “We need a wall like this because</br>
    These invaders are coming onto our private land</br>
    They’re smuggling drugs and people and contraband—</br>
        They’re takin our jobs!—</br>
    bunch a criminals!”</p>

    <p>Well we walked up a hill and peeped the horizon</br>
    saw a crowd of people there building something</br>
    he said “some day barbed wire, brick and mortar</br>
    is all there’ll be at the US-Mexico border”</br>
        I could feel the fake news starting to wear off</br>
        And a new nightmare beginning</p>

        <p>We came to a pen made of chainlink fence</br>
    Inside was a hundred or so immigrants</br>
    Most of them was kids, emaciated</br>
    They’d been took from their parents, incarcerated</br> 
        Maybe orphaned, too</br>
        No tellin</p>

        <p>I asked one of em why he decided to come across</br>
    He shook his head, sighed and coughed</br>
    Said, before I answer let me ask you one</br>
    If it was leave or die, which would you have done?</br>
        I said I guess I’d leave</br>
        He didn’t look at me after that</p>

        <p>Just when I thought it couldn’t get any sadder</br>
    My tour guide pulls out a big old ladder</br>
    we climbed, looked out, and all I seed</br>
    was a cactus plant and a tumbleweed</br>
        where’s that immigrant threat I was hearing so much about?</br>
        national emergency my eye!</p>		

        <p>Trump doesn’t want foreigners comin across</br>
    And a few billion tax-dollars is all it’ll cost</br>
    when the proposal to congress finally went around</br>
    they wouldn’t budge so he shut it down</br>
    talk about stealing work</br>
        From hard-working Americans</p>

    <p>You go far enough back on that family tree</br>
    You’ll find Trump had ancestors over in Germany</br>
    They came and settled in the American nation</br>
    in a process that’s known as—what?—immigration</br>
    hung around for the revolution</br>
    helped establish the American hypocrisy</p>

    <p>Humpdy Trumpty can sit on his wall</br>
    The higher he builds it, the harder the fall</br>
    All the kings horses and all the kings men</br>
    won’t be electing him again</br>
        they’ll know better</br>
        least I hope they will…</p>

    A plainclothes armadillo from the outskirts of Amarillo
    4			1			5	5(seventh)
    Patches sewn on at the elbows and a bandage on his nose
    Hauling nothing but a suitcase he was yielded in a carchase
    Didn’t want it in the firstplace but ain’t that just the way life goes?
        4			6			5
    Aint that just the way life goes a mile a minute
    4			6			5
    Trine to tell you you did something even when you didn’t?
    
    <p>Hitched a ride from Missoula where he bid farwell to Julia
    Aw, don’t let his smiling fool ya, he’s as heartbroke as they come
    And now he’s stranded on his isthmus, won’t be comin home for Christmas
    And no one wants to know the business of a stranger with a gun-
        Of a stranger with a gun-shy disposition
        Who talks as if he’s on some kind of mission	
    
        <p>4			1		5		6
        and they’ve got Aesop on the hotline, going on about the decline
        4			1			5
        in the quality, since his time, of the moral and the good
        4			1		3(seventh)		4
        How the list of who accused whom in the crimes they lost the clues to
        1			4				5
    how they don’t write em like they used to—and how they never even could
        4			6			5
    how they never could achieve what they attempted
    4			6			5
        how in spite of that they tried it, unprevented
    
        <p> walking barefoot on the shoulder of the highway, growing older
    all the things he never told her falling wasted in the dust
    once an eligible suitor whose chances became fewer
    til now he’s just one more commuter standing trine to catch a bus
        trine to catch a bus that’ll keep him off the blacktop
        he’s got to fight to keep his place back in the backdrop
        
    <p>meanwhile tortoise is sipping Cocoa at a foodtruck in Alcopoco
    Handing money to a hobo for a crumpled paper bag
    And further down the filmrole they’ve got Fox out at the flagpole
    Setting fire to his foxhole looking anything but sad
        Looking anything but sad, or scared, or sorry
        it’ll hang ‘im if it gets before a jury—	
        
        <p>And they’ve got mother goose on speaker who’s out-professed the teacher
    sayin, “the outlook’s getting bleaker, the whole future’s being hid,”
    these ideals we gave our youths to, the hypocrisy has oozed through
    how they don’t make em like they used to—how they never even did
        how they never did prepare us for this chapter
        you bare your soul, the response is often laughter
        
        <p>There’s a jukebox, but it’s broken, in the only restaurant open
    At this hour, where devotion’s the only currency you’ll find
    And the waitress, Dolores, sings along to her own chorus
    Like she knew what it meant for us to hear a voice that sounded kind
        To hear a voice that sounded kind of like forgiveness
        That seemed to look back and say, This isn’t that place—is this?
    
        <p>Across the street he hits the front door, throws the briefcase on the bankfloor
    says to empty out the cashdrawer—dares them all to call his bluff
    and as he shoots the guard to ribbon, he says, “I also got my livin,”
    and the soundtrack’s Nancy Griffin singing “Not Innocent Enough”
        not innocent enough to be omitted 	
        from the penalty for crimes someone else committed
    
        <p>there’s a prophet on the mountain, lambs and children all around him
        the wisdom that he’s spoutin rhymes with violence and fear
        and the music a body moves to sometimes needs a little getting used to
        but they don’t write it now like they used to—at least not around here
            at least not around here that I’m aware of
            but then awareness, you know, I’ve never had my share of
    
    <p>he’s got a hideout in Savannah and a lean-to in TexArkana
    but they’re staking out Atlanta like they knew it in advance
    and if he’s half as bold as they say he won’t make it past the runway
    and it’ll be as red a Sunday as Vengeance himself grants
        as Vengeance himself grants his pious precinct
        the sheriff of whom fires out of instinct
    
    <p>neath the torn tarp of some Chevy, he raps twice to say he’s ready
    but the signal’s slow and heavy like he knew his match was met
    Should have known, it’d be just like you to leave me in a Haiku:
    Ain’t it just like fall
    -ing off a bike? you never 
    do learn to forget
        You never do learn to forget the face that sees you
        That you know, when you are gone, will mourn and grieve you

    She’s been sleepin since this morning

    And if you ask me, it’s okay</p>
    
    She’s been winking at the window
    Like she ain’t got long to stay
    She moves her mouth but nothing comes now
    Aw, but what else is there to say?
    
        Come on over to my bedside
        Pull your poor self up a chair
        And if you still need to do something
        Don’t just do something, sit there
    
    Here’s your hat, what’s your hurry?
    Don’t you even want to know the score?
    When you leave like this I worry
    You don’t know what you’re leaving for
    
    Put your phone down for a minute
    And turn off that damn TV
    There’s so much noise I cannot hear it
    There’s so much light I cannot see
    
        Come on over to my table
        Pull your poor self up a chair
        And if you still need to do something
        Don’t just do something—sit there
    
    It seems there’s method to the madness
    That seeks to keep us entertained
    That aims to keep us from our sadness
    And distract us from our pain
    
    They’ve got us right where they want us
    We’re in the middle of their palm
    They’ve made our business into a contest
    So the revolution might be calm
    
        We’ve been kindly asked to exit
        Order’s come down from upstairs
        So if you still need to do something
        Don’t just do something—sit there

        my wrench it went inside the gears—
        the smoke ascends, but my head clears—		
        yeah, and I ain’t felt this good in years:

        Just what all the fuss all about—
        
        The system that they built has failed
        The letters home were never mailed
        These presidents should all be jailed
        But we had our chance, and that ship has sailed
            A commotion started, it got loud
        behind me, so I turned around
            Ceiling came down, so I run out
            I still don’t know what all the fuss was about
        
        I tried my hand at rambling free
        The highway called, I went to see
        I got caught up, went on a spree
        Pretty soon now they’ll be after me
            What goes around comes back around
            you lift off just to run aground
            like it was precious, they made it sound— 
            but I still don’t know what all the fuss is about
        
        Your story entertained me, yes,
        But I was the host, you were my guest
        Now that I’ve had time to digest
        I guess it’s left me… unimpressed—
            I know it puts me far from the crowd
            To bring my feelings to my mouth
            I can see you’re through and that you’re proud— 
            I just don’t know what all the fuss is about	
        
        Preoccupied and indisposed
        Are names I go by, I suppose
        I tell my sins to the wind that blows
        I wear confusion better than my own clothes
            You keep on wandering along the route
            Any further and you’ll be out 
            They said to keep a close eye out
        I don’t know what all the fuss is about
        
        born in the gutter to face the stars
        to wonder: is there life on Mars?
        Back on earth, you compare your scars
        Inventing stories of how we got this far
            You run until your time runs out
            There’s little you can get by without 
            You play it sacred, safe, devout— 
            And you never learn what all the fuss was about

        She brought him home one night to meet her folks
        He’d laughed at all her father’s lousy jokes
        He didn’t know the difference between barleycorn and oats
        But he was easy on the eyes, she used to say
        
        She’d grown up on small ohio farm

        they met at the Orville county dance
        he said he hadn’t come for true love or romance
        with a single folded dollar in the pocket of his pants
        but he was easy on the eyes, she used to say
        
        after that they saw each other more
        he’d stop by every day at half-past-four
        he did that until the autumn, when he went away to war
        but he was easy on the eyes, she used to say
        
        before he left they married in the church
        the choir sang a prelude and a dirge
        they promised one another they were finished with their search
        and he was easy on the eyes, she used to say
        
        the baby came the same day as the note
        her water broke the sobbing in her throat
        and because there was no other way the baby would have known it
        he was easy on the eyes, she used to say

        When he made it into Ninevah, he told everybody there:
        Lord, but ain’t it good to be alive?
        
        Can’t look ahead to nothing, when you’re just lookin to get by

            Ain’t it good to feel the summer breeze?
            Blowing through the canyons, oer the rivers, rocks and trees?
        It’s a match fixed from the get-go, we’re all on the losing side
        Lord, but ain’t it good to be alive?
        
        World is full of problems that I don’t know how to fix
        When the Lord gets down to something, the devil’s up to his old tricks
        Just when you think you’re in control the bucket goes and kicks
        Lord, but ain’t it good to be alive?
        
        Time is of the essence, and the essence ain’t that strong
        I ain’t sayin I could do without it—man, don’t get me wrong
        It’s no fun while it lasts and it don’t even last that long
        Lord, but ain’t it good to be alive?
        
            Aint it good to see your children smile?
            to know that what you’ve started may continue for awhile
        I don’t know what it’s all about, I couldn’t tell you why— 
        Lord, but ain’t it good to be alive?	
        
        I’ve had me plenty enemies and plenty worthy foes
        Most of them began as friends—but so the story goes
        Come harvest time a man’s crop don’t amount to what he sews
        Lord, but ain’t it good to be alive?
        
        It’s always up for auction, what is false and what is true
        It comes down to a difference in a different point of view
        But I wouldn’t trade a minute of the time I spent with you—
        Lord, you make me glad to be alive
        
        Aint it good to know it ain’t the end?
            To look back on your life and know you had some kind of friend? 
        We all know what’s coming, it ain’t no surprise—
        Lord but ain’t it good to be alive?

        Young Dylan Thomas was a poet of promise, and a regular fly at the bar
        He could always begin em when he had a few in him, but sometimes he’d go in too far
        One night he got hammered and drunkenly stammered he could outdrink the thirstiest bloke
        And when he’d done fifty he said, “Ain’t it nifty? My own record’s finally broke!”
            chorus
        
        tornado season in Kansas is reason for residents to head for the hills
        but others’ll settle in, shooting adrenaline and chase the things down just for thrills 
        it’s many a weatherman’s perished a’weatherin a storm that’s come barreling through
        saying, Don’t worry about me, I’m just going to see — I’ll be coming right back in a few—
            chorus
        
        Julius Caesar was a real people-pleaser, opinioned and quite talkative
        But the people around him in the senate room found him to be less than cooperative 
        One day in session the whole senate drew weapons, he said, “What is it you’re planning to do?”
        And as each stab betrayed, all he managed to say was, “Brutus! don’t tell me—you too?”
            Chorus
        
        I heard of a felon they convicted for telling lies to the country he served
        The history-writers, his champion indicters, all say he got what he deserved
        With the gas-chamber filling, they bade him speak, willing, as the newsmen took up their pens:
        He said “I’d say I was sorry, but it ain’t gonna save me, so let’s just get on with it then.”
            Chorus
        
        Well Jesus of Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem, Galilee—you take your pick
        Travelled around making lost people found, feeding hungry folks, and healing the sick
        For all of his parables, disciples and miracles you’d think his end might’ve been better than
        Having a spear in his side, nothin left of his pride, cept to say, “Well, it’s finished, Amen.”
            Chorus
        
        Poor old man Socrates stood trial and penalty for corrupting the youth of his day
        Plato recorded the affair in its sorted detail that reads like a play
        Convicted and sentenced they sent his apprentice with a meal and hemlock for dessert
        In a terrible thirst he took the drink first and said, “O my god but it hurts!”

        His name was Jonathan Barclay / We was good pals, him and I
        lived on my block, across the way / you never met a nicer guy—
        we worked together in the factory / the summer school let out for good
        he said his dream was getting free / he said he’d try, and I knew he would
        
        one day while he was on the clock / a misstep did him injury
        they hauled him off the loading dock / to Sacred Heart Emergency
        a few days later he was back in-line / with a prescription they said was for the pain
        the doctors said that he would heal up fine / of course he never was the same again
        
        in a while his need had grown mature / he couldn’t do without em then
        and when the doctors couldn’t give no more / he turned to using heroin
        one day the foreman came to John and said, “you’re a good man, john, that much you know,” 
        but for the drug-test results I just read, we’re gonna have to let you go…” 
        
        next night he tried to buy some more / after hunting all day for a job
        a stranger showed him something, John said, “Sure,” / turned out he was an undercover cop—
        he did his first six months in the county pen / they sent him upstate to serve the rest 
        four years later he got out again / but his house was sold and his wife had left…
        
        so he hit the streets both clean and free—but only in a narrow sense
        cause employers won’t take parolees—and as for housing? Not a chance—
        but he used the systems that were in place—that are supposed to help out folks like him 
        in the shelters he never did feel safe—and luck has a way of wearing thin
        
        and soon he stood before the judge, who asked him why he made the choice
        to use again, illegal drugs? John answered in a shaking voice:
        you might as well be asking why a sick man takes his medicine—
        if he doesn’t take it, he will die—show me where choice here factors in? 
        
        they give you something that you’ll need to live and you’ll take it cause it’s for the pain
        then when you’re hooked they cut you off, and so you take the outlaw’s medicine
        and for that you sentence time and guilt, and while you’re in, the rest dissolves
        this is the system that you’ve built to make the door to death revolve—“
        
        He did another stint away / came back a reeling, hungry ghost
        His obit in the papers say / his cause of death was overdose
        His name was Jonathan Barclay / his story makes me think sometimes
        That if the cards were dealt some other way / it could easily have been yours or mine

        There once was a man name of Hannible Lee, he was well-known in his hometown
        4				1			5			1
        Said he was born at the top of an ugly tree and hit every branch on his way down
        5				1			5			1
        Well one day he vanished, some thought he had died, gone so long folks was plumb ashamed—
        4				1			5			1
        But then he turned up, had a girl at his side who had gone and taken his last name
            3				4					3		4
            And everyone wondered how it came about, they thought: she’s much too pretty for Lee
            3				4					5		5(7th)
        Either she’s blind or her contacts fell out, or no, wait a minute, I think I see: 
            4			1		5			1
                He must’ve made a deal with the devil, surrendered it all I’m sure 
                4			1		5			1
                Sold in his soul for collateral, how else’d he win a girl like her?
        
        There once lived a man named of Bobby J., Mississippi born and bred
        Until his 20th year, there was little to say, folks thought he’d sharecrop til he was dead
        Well one day he vanished, to where, nobody saw, his name was something they’d soon forget
        But when he came back, he was playing guitar— And folks ain’t quit talking bout it yet 
        They said: How did he do it? It don’t make no sense! A gift like that can’t come free—
        If I had to wager an educated guess There’s only one explanation that I can see
        Must’ve made a deal with the devil, I think it’s pretty well understood
                Sold in his soul for collateral, How else’d he learn to play so good?
        
        There once lived a man who had it real bad, a case of prideful ambition that showed—
        In the time it took most to get through their undergrad, he’d had gone and mastered all there was to know
        Faustus, they called him, and “Doctor” by day—one of them know-it-all ne’er-do-well
        Gave a brand new meaning to the age-old phrase “smarter than all hell”
            His colleagues suspected something was up, but they never could discover the source
        Then at the snap of his fingers his number came up, and everybody said, “obviously! of course!”
                He must’ve made a deal with the devil, success always precedes a fall
                Sold in his soul for collateral, else he’d’ve never made it as a doctor at all
        
        Way back when, a few centuries past, before anybody here was around
        A rash of executions up Salem Mass was the talk of every New England town
        What had started it all would have been hard to say, most of the records have been lost to time 
        The contemporary papers read, anyway, that women had been speaking their minds
            And everyone wondered: how this could be? It just wasn’t the puritan way— 
        in a White Male Anglican Theocracy, just one thing that could make a woman stray:
        Must’ve made a deal with the devil / they thought it was safe to say:
                Sold in their souls for collateral / how else’d they’d learn to disobey?
        
        There once lived a man by the name of Job, he was righteous in just about every way
        When the times were good his happiness flowed, and he never did forget to pray
        One day his fortune was suddenly reversed, into tragedy he was violently hurled
        He wept and he prayed while his wife wept and cursed, and said “there’s no justice in this world”
            well he rent all his clothes and furrowed his brow, and didn’t say a word for a week
            Then his wife asked him where he thought his God was now, and it was all he could do to speak:
        Job said: he must’ve made a deal with the devil, that must have been the course he chose
        But what he did it for, I’ll never be sure—God help us if Heaven knows!

    <p>    1					6
        A man outstanding on the ledge / of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge
        4					5
        is demanding that somebody fetch / a friend, whose name he won't say
        the negotiator, he arrives / with 5 women he's identified
        four of them are his ex-wives and one claims she's his fiance
        a ladder from the truck extends to the lamppost that he's up against
        an hour later he descends, his tongue swollen and bitten
        the bride-to-be asks on a hunch if the negotiator knew at once
        "How did you know he wouldn't jump?" and he replies, "I didn't-- but
        I been doing this awhile –I been doing this awhile
        I been doing this awhile –I been doing this awhile…”
        
        they sent a man from management / to greet the only candidate 
        "you're a step up from inanimate," he said, smiling through a paint-on 
        they started him on sweeping floors / next they had him holding doors
        he got so good at doing chores his entire life became one
        he retired to the mezzanine of the Hotel d'Medici
        and remained a curiosity til the day they mummified him 
        the guests, chauffeurs and visitors who got lost on the city tours
        would have him tell them where they were and he would unfailingly advise them, saying
        chorus
        
        some monster broke the doctor's mold / then set off in the freezing cold
        the footprints lead right to the road that goes to civilization
        a flash mob has convened to search / composed of members of the church
        who believe that what don't kill or hurt ain't worthy of salvation
        nearby in the parking lot / where Jacob and the angel fought
        the detective and the thief he caught / are gazing at Orion
        the name's writ on the dotted line where the borrower's been asked to sign
        if you can't win friends by bein kind, don't think you cannot buy them
        chorus
        
        The apprentice solved the mystery / of the killer who deliberately
        left the clues for all to see / at least those that were willing
        they seemed so disparate and forced / at first, but then again, of course
        the magician must reveal his source to keep his own blood from spilling
        they caught him in the sulfur mine where'd he'd committed heinous crimes
        they saved a woman just in time from falling victim to his purpose
        the commissioner read his rights and spit which convinced him to own up to it
        sayin, "If you think this was all I did--man, you ain't but scratched the surface--"
        chorus
        
        I knealt outside your balcony / for what felt like eternity
        but you never came to look for me / you were too busy with your lover
        the lights were on, the shades above / were drawn, your shadows, making love
        was all I saw from where I was -- you were so good to each other
        I should have left, I knew it then / call it trespasser's acumen
        but there I stayed til it was done / and you emerged, soliloquizing
        your thoughts went soaring like a prayer / that hasn't anything to spare
        and when you cried out "Are you there?" -- it sounded like apologizing
        chorus
        
        I come in here most every week / a pitstop on my losing streak / 
        with nothing new of which to speak / on the subject of the City
        I sit down on my favorite stool / order up my usual /
        the waitress knows me for the fool / I am but she's got pity
        on stage a man is going on about how and why he wrote some song
        he sings and we all sing along and for a minute life's less lonely
        he steps out smoking afterwards to proselytize the amateurs 
        whose praise he says is for the birds, he says the difference tween us is only 
        chorus
        
        with one wave of a magic wand your absence makes the heart grow fond
        in me a starving vagabond is riding on a boxcar
        the country unwinds as from a spool that uses yesterday for fuel
        propelling me to my renewal, the sense that, permanently, I’ve lost her
        my letters haven't gotten through cause I still ain't heard back from you
        it seems no matter what I do, the goalpost keeps retreating
        friends, like heroes, come and go / like David's Michaelangelo
        this isn't my first rodeo / and perhaps it bears repeating:
        chorus

    <p>  4	1		4	1
    Time’s come to say fare thee well
    6	5		4	1
    If I don’t go now I probably never will
    4	1		3	4
    Feels like I’m fightin a battle, and it’s all up-hill
    1				4		5
    What’s waiting at the top—Lord, I just can’t tell
    
    Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure glad I came
    Tho I could’ve done without all the cause to complain
    And tho I don’t know when I’ll be back this way again
    You know I’ll look you up first chance I can
    
        The car’s packed, the house is sold
        we’ll be gone tomorrow fore the rooster’s crowed	
    But you know our story ain’t but even half-way told
    I’ll be down, just around the first bend in the road
    
    No one gets it right, but hell, we’re all trine
    the postman can’t seem to deliver a thing on time
    just like I know you ain’t when you say you’re fine
    By now I’ve learned to read a little in-between the lines
    
    I’ve been bottom-feedin at the literal dregs
    Spurred on by dissatisfaction from one town to the next
    I arrive with the rumor of what everyone expects
    When I leave it’s with my tail in between my legs
    
    chorus
    
    I gave all I had, and now I’m all used up
    You can’t keep on pourin from an empty cup
    It’s been so long since I felt like I’s anything but stuck
    Whether fate or free will, right now it feels like luck—
    
    BRIDGE
        4		1		5		1
    whether for or against, asleep or awake
        4		1		5		1
    whether it’s everything or nothing that’s at the stake
        4		1		5		1
    Whether three or three thousand, feet or miles, give or take
        4		1				5		
    Beyond the bend in the road, what difference does it make?
    
    chorus
    
    Don’t say Goodbye—a Fare-thee-well will do
    Or until next time, sayanora, so long, too-da-loo
    I hate to know that you feel so blue
    but I’d be lyin if I said I ain’t gonna miss you, too
    
    This hand makes the chords while this one strums
    Heart keeps the rhythm and you sing from the lungs
    You need a little bit of grace, I’m all thumbs
    But just cause I ain’t pretty don’t mean I deserve the crumbs
    
    Chorus
    
    My hunger you’ve nourished, my nakedness clothed
    you know all of my secrets, you taught me your code:
    the way out’s uncertain; the way home’s been showed
    I’ll be down just around the first bend in the road
