    <p>Hey ma, wake up it’s me, it’s your boy, Tom Joad<br>
    I’d love to but I can’t stay long, I’ve gotta hit the road<br>
    In the morning they’ll be lookin for me high up and down low<br>
    Cops from every county from Salinas to Frisco</p>
    
    <p>But I only got a minute here so I won’t make this long<br>
    I ain’t always done the right thing, hell, sometimes I been wrong<br>
    But as long as I am gonna be an outlaw from now on<br>
    Wherever there’s a stone unturned, hereby, I swear—</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        Wherever you can go to think some lonesome thought<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>
    
    <p>I’m ingredient to humankind, a partial to the whole<br>
    Tho I walk upon the stage of life I play a minor role<br>
    I am portion to the giant universal human soul<br>
    Which exists within everybody everywhere</p>
    
    <p>So I’ll be there when you’re weary, when you’re lonesome and afraid<br>
    When the delivery of all that you’ve been promised aint been made<br>
    When there ain’t no superhero to come rushin to your aid<br>
    When you got everything to lose and no time to spare</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        When the road becomes too narrow and the wilderness too broad<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>
    
    <p>I will be in every crevice of this bright world that’s gone dark<br>
    I will be in every desperate hallow achin broken heart<br>
    Long after its all over and well before it starts<br>
    Anyplace that folks can’t go or just don’t dare</p>
    
    <p>Wherever there’s a stranger sayin I’m too young to die<br>
    Wherever there’s a prayer that’s bein prayed up to the sky<br>
    Wherever there’s an angry cop just beatin up some guy<br>
    And the fight just don’t seem justified nor fair</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        So the one’s that go unseen unheard won’t be forgot<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>
    
    <p>Wherever fights’re brewin up so that hungry folks can eat<br>
    Wherever there’s a cry for revolution in the street<br>
    Wherever there’s a stranger who ain’t marchin to the beat<br>
    Who repels his last companion as he draws a stare</p>
    
    <p>In the way that guys start yelling when they’re stark raving mad<br>
    In the sighin folks’re doing who’ve lost everything they’ve had<br>
    In the singin and the laughin of the children when they’re glad<br>
    In the cryin and the quiet of when they’re scared</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        In the worry of the guilty ones that ain’t yet been caught<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        I will be there so help me God</p>
    
    <p>I guess I’d better go now, ma, cause soon it will be dawn<br>
    I’d just like to say I’m sorry for all the screwing up I done<br>
    But just cause I ain’t here no more it doesn’t mean I’m gone<br>
    I will be with you on every step of every stair</p>
    
    <p>Tomorrow when they come for me, you tell em I was here<br>
    Tell em that you saw me but that you didn’t see me clear<br>
    Tell em I’m the echo that’s been whispering in your ear<br>
    Tell em if they’re looking for me anywhere</p>
    
        <p>I will be there, I will be there<br>
        Wherever someone’s lonesome in a stranded spot<br>
        I will be there, I will be there<br>
        Wherever folks are thirsty and can’t find a drop<br>
        Wherever there’s a road that ain’t been tried or trod<br> 
        Wherever I am wanted pursued or sought<br>
        I will be there, I will be there <br>
        I will be there, so help me God</p>

    <p>Come mothers and fathers, come sisters and brothers<br>
    Lend an ear to the stories they’re telling<br>
    Of the neighborhood watchman in the Florida town<br>
    Who shot and killed Trayvon Martin</p>
    
    <p>O, the time it was night and the evening was cold<br>
    And the month it was late February<br>
    Trayvon Martin at only seventeen years old<br>
    Too young for an obituary</p>
    
    <p>On his way back home from a convenience store <br>
    Through the yards of his neighbors was walkin<br>
    George Zimmerman spied him while making his rounds<br>
    And made a call down to the station</p>
    
    <p>“HQ, HQ,” Mr. Zimmerman said,<br>
    “This is nightwatchman Zimmerman calling,<br>
    I have just spied a suspicious black male<br>
    In our gated community walking—</p>
    
    <p>“How shall I proceed, shall I make an arrest<br>
    Shall I follow and see where he takes me?<br>
    Could this be the man whom we’ve been looking for<br>
    Who committed those robberies lately?”</p>
    
    <p>“Well this is HQ,” the headquarters said,<br>
    “To nightwatchman Zimmerman calling,<br>
    Do not pursue—repeat—do not pursue,<br>
    For you haven’t the grounds to suspect him.”</p>
    
    <p>“Ten four, ten four,” Mr. Zimmerman said,<br>
    But he pulled up to roll slowly by him,<br>
    And when the young man saw the slow police car<br>
    He took off a fearfully runnin</p>
    
    <p>“No grounds? No grounds?” Mr. Zimmerman thought<br>
    “If there’s no grounds then why is he running?”<br>
    And quick as a flash he leapt out of his car<br>
    Bringing his handgun with him</p>
    
    <p>Well over a fence and through the back yards<br>
    The armed officer chased Trayvon Martin<br>
    A distance in excess of one hundred yards<br>
    Til he finally cornered and caught him</p>
    
    <p>O down, O down to the ground they did fall<br>
    The ground where they both had been standing<br>
    Trayvon to fight for his life gainst the man<br>
    The man for to somehow subdue him</p>
    
    <p>“Submit, submit!” ficer Zimmerman cried<br>
    “Submit and throw down your weapon!”<br>
    “I will not submit!” Trayvon Martin replied,<br>
    “For I’m unarmed and I haven’t done nothing!”</p>
    
    <p>And as the two fought on the ground in the dark<br>
    A gunshot rang out clear as crystal<br>
    Trayvon Martin had been shot through the chest<br>
    At close range by Zimmerman’s pistol</p>
    
    <p>Come mothers and fathers, come sisters and brothers<br>
    Lend an ear to the stories they’re telling<br>
    Of the neighborhood watchman in the Florida town<br>
    Who shot and killed Trayvon Martin</p>
    
    <p>For a day and a night the body went without name<br>
    As he was when his mother had birthed him<br>
    Until a call came from his father at home<br>
    Saying that his son had been missing</p>
    
    <p>O down, o down to the morgue he was called<br>
    To see if this was his son who’d been missing<br>
    “O, God, it’s him!” his bereaved father cried,<br>
    “That’s the body of Trayvon Martin,”</p>
    
    <p>“My son, my son, O Trayvon, my son—”<br>
    His poor mother cried, nearly wild,<br>
    “He wasn’t no symbol, didn’t die for no cause,<br>
    He was only my baby, my child,</p>
    
    <p>“And what did he do, for what was he killed,<br>
    For wearing dark clothes and a hoodie?<br>
    Is it just me or does it still feel <br>
    Like it’s a crime to be black in this country?”</p>
    
    <p>Well charges were pressed and a trial was set <br>
    And a jury was formed all at random<br>
    And of the twelve who were chosen to serve,<br>
    There wasn’t one black face among them</p>
    
    <p>“The defendant, George Zimmerman,” the prosecution declared,<br>
    “He is getting away here with murder;<br>
    How can you defend a defender of peace<br>
    Who says shoot first and ask questions later?”</p>
    
    <p>“Yes, that was my gun, I fired that round,”<br>
    George Zimmerman finally admitted<br>
    But despite all the facts in the end he was found<br>
    Not guilty and was fully acquitted</p>
    
    <p>The defense lawyers claimed he had just stood his ground<br>
    And no evidence showed the contrary<br>
    Trayvon Martin by then for more than a year<br>
    Neath six feet of ground had lain buried</p>
    
    <p>And for all you who say that here justice was done,<br>
    Here is something for you to consider:<br>
    When a white man shoots and unarmed black man to death<br>
    They do not define it as murder</p>
    
    <p>Come judges, come kings, come you counselors on down<br>
    Who maintain the law’s fair and equal<br>
    Come look what they done in a florida town<br>
    And say it would be the same for all people</p>

    <h2>Two Geese</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Sam Steffen EP, 2014</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#samSteffenEP_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Two geese flew over the house lastnight, a gentle music played upon their wings<br>
    The sun had softened to an evening light, my mind was overfilled with things<br>
    They came from somewhere well behind the sun, made their way out over the pond<br>
    And tho I didn’t see from where they’d come, I watched them til they’d gone</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they flew so close<br>
        That silence seemed to sail between them both<br>
        Perhaps I’m only more bemused than most<br>
            And by the simplest things I see<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>I turned from the window and I went downstairs, and I stepped out into the yard<br>
    December’s always been this wet and cold, but it’s never felt this hard<br>
    I pulled the clothes in down from off the line just as the stars began to cloud<br>
    And tho I hadn’t in the longest time, I said your name out loud</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they stayed in stride<br>
        Flying freely tho side by side<br>
        Perhaps I haven’t anything to hide<br>
            Or very much that’s left to lose<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>I brought a log in down from off the pile and I tossed it on the coals<br>
    I fanned and coaxed it for a little while until that flame burned bright and full<br>
    And as the fire raged within the hearth and I grew more conscious and wide awake<br>
    A peace within my soul was perched, but those two birds I couldn’t shake</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they flew so fast<br>
        Out of the future right into the past<br>
        Perhaps there’s nothing that’s really meant to last<br>
            That wasn’t born to stay<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>Now, the midnight sky in east Vermont is darker than you might suppose<br>
    And the stars you wait upon and want are seldom undisclosed<br>
    I read for a while, and then I went to bed, feeling distracted to say the least<br>
    And for a long time after I put down my head, I thought about those geese</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way they seemed to fear<br>
        That they were too far north for this time of year<br>
        Or something about the way they disappeared<br>
            Right when they were close enough to hold<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>
 
    <p>I woke this morning to a shade of sun, pressing warmly up against my face<br>
    And tho I knew I’d be the only one, I did not disturb your place<br>
    I got to my legs and then I stood upright, before the window I threw wide the blinds<br>
    Two geese flew over the house last-night, this morning you were on my mind</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps it was the way it seemed their fate<br>
        That after nearing they would separate<br>
        Perhaps it’s just that it was getting late<br>
            And they’d come right out of the blue<br>
        But something bout the way those two geese flew<br>
        Reminded me of you</p>

    <p>Might be raining, might be snowing<br>
    That old north wind, she might be blowing<br>
    Through the treetops, down the sidewalks, <br>
    Past the rest-stops of this restless world<br>
    But tonight, babe, I am not afraid<br>
    I will not be roused before the dawn<br>
    For I have travelled a thousand miles<br>
    And cept to sleep I don’t know where I’m goin</p>
 
    <p>Come tomorrow but please come slowly<br>
    Shine your lights on but shine them lowly<br>
    For in the nighttime sweet sleep she takes me<br>
    Through my dreams until she forsakes me<br>
    Beyond the brink of what I can think of<br>
    With my weary waking mind<br>
    Let her lead me, let her deceive me,<br>
    But o please let me leave my cares behind</p>
 
    <p>I may be unlovely, may not have money<br>
    Seldom a ceiling over and above me<br>
    May come a beggar and leave a debtor<br>
    Having only my dreams to offer<br>
    But in my dreams you are always with me<br>
    Lying beside me up within my bed<br>
    And dreaming’s easy, when you’re weary<br>
    I do it every place I rest my head </p>

    <h2>A Twenty-Something College Graduate's Talkin Blues</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Sam Steffen EP, 2014</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#samSteffenEP_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>A while back I spose it hasn’t been too long<br>
    To a certain institution I used to belong<br>
    Where I spent four years and learned all the rules<br>
    And how to tell between the wise and the fools<br>
        I’m not talking about prison<br>
        It was a college, of the liberal arts variety</p>
 
    <p>Well we all got told to save the date<br>
    As the time was comin for us to graduate<br>
    And I guess you could say we were pretty excited<br>
    Everyone we knew had been invited<br>
        Folks and friends, friends of friends,<br>
        Heck, even the neighbors were there</p>
 
    <p>Well until at last the day was come<br>
    And our dean was standin up at the podium<br>
    And he made this speech it didn’t sound too subtle<br>
    He said, I’ll be honest, you’re all in trouble<br>
        And I’m not talking about academics<br>
        I’m talking about life now, now’s when the learning starts</p>
 
    <p>I can say right now it didn’t feel too good<br>
    To have to hear all that I knew I would<br>
    But we all went up and we shook his hand <br>
    And he said someday we’d understand<br>
        And I took my diploma<br>
        No secrets, that thing was just a piece of paper</p>
 
    <p>Well somehow I had made the grade,<br>
    Had a scholarship for my financial aide<br>
    And everyone was saying it would all be fine<br>
    You just take it easy, now, and take your time<br>
        You’ll have a job soon<br>
        Just gotta see what’s there—stay positive</p>
 
    <p>Well before I cleared out they sent me a notice<br>
    Said they wanted to see me at the financial office<br>
    So they called me in, said Take a seat<br>
    Wrote me out this big receipt<br>
        I said, what is this?<br>
        They laughed at me, said, You’re kidding, right?</p>
 
    <p>Well I told the woman to knock it off<br>
    It’ll take me ten years to pay this off<br>
    She said that’s right it’s called a ten year plan<br>
    That should be easy enough to understand<br>
        Aint it? for a smart-looking college graduate like you</p>
 
    <p>She said not to worry though, I’m sure<br>
    Youll find a job somewhere with that degree of yours<br>
    She said maybe I can help you, say what’s it in<br>
    I said 19th century American Literature—she laughed again<br>
        A veritable cackle that woman had<br>
        I never knew I was so funny</p>
 
    <p>Now in college you can learn to think<br>
    To read to write to speak to drink<br>
    And all of that can be put to use <br>
    As a post-graduate on the career caboose<br>
        Especially the drinkin—job huntin<br>
        And no luck on account of you’re overqualified</p>
 
    <p>Well it wouldn’t be so bad I guess<br>
    Cept the conomy’s broke and the world’s a mess<br>
    And you can’t get hired for a minimum wage<br>
    And there’s nothing for you on the classifieds page<br>
        You just sit around, feeling sorry<br>
        Got lots of time to read though</p>
 
    <p>Well, when I was finally through procrastinatin<br>
    I filled me out a labor application<br>
    Took a little math test, they gave me a cup<br>
    Showed me to the bathroom and said, filler up!<br>
        I passed that math test<br>
        The other one came back inconclusive</p>
 
    <p>Few days later they got a hold of me<br>
    Said they had a job waiting for me at the factory<br>
    Said to show on up and to be on time<br>
    You’ll be standing all day on the ssembly line<br>
        And they weren’t kidding—I stood in one place for 8 hours<br>
        Didn’t have a productive thought the whole time</p>
 
    <p>Well I did this I guess for about a week<br>
    Losing all kinds of time to work and sleep<br>
    And one day the foreman says I look like hell<br>
    And I says I know it man, he says well—<br>
        What can you do? Sometimes life just slips away<br>
        You gotta work though, or its hell to pay</p>
 
    <p>He said you know I always meant to go to college<br>
    To fill my head up with all kinds of knowledge<br>
    I said if I were him, I’d be apprehensive<br>
    It’s grand and all, but man, it’s expensive<br>
        He looked at me, he said, you mean you been to school?<br>
        I said, yeah, of course!</p>
 
    <p>Well I don’t think my comments were appreciated<br>
    Next day I found out I’d been terminated<br>
    I said what gives he says You wont miss it<br>
    You got a diploma—go do something with it</p>
 
    <p>Well I’ve had a couple of jobs since then<br>
    Couple of gigs with a couple of friends<br>
    Bought a bus ticket, pulled an all-nighter<br>
    Moved to Nashville, became a songwriter<br>
        It’s a pretty shabby way to make a living<br>
        All tips, and not too many of em, either—</p>

    <p>I don’t want to say I’m sorry<br>
    I don’t want to make it better<br>
    I don’t want to tell you I was wrong<br>
    I don’t want to be a grown-up<br>
    I don’t want to write no letter<br>
    I don’t want to show you I can be strong<br>
        All I want is to be left alone<br>
        For to lick my wounds and nurse my bruise<br>
        To get old quickly and remain unknown<br>
        But to sing—the blues</p>
 
    <p>I don’t want to listen to ya<br>
    I don’t want to be there for ya<br>
    I don’t want to reach out no helpin hand<br>
    I don’t want to hear what you think<br>
    I don’t want to owe you nothing<br>
    I don’t want no one to understand<br>
        All I want is to be sent on home<br>
        For my behavior to remain unexcused<br>
        To reap far less than what I have sewn<br>
        But to sing—the blues</p>
 
    <p>I don’t want to keep my voice down<br>
    I don’t want to hold my head up<br>
    I don’t want to play the game no more<br>
    I don’t want to hold my tears in<br>
    I don’t want to keep from hurting<br>
    I don’t want it to go on like before<br>
        All I want is to roll my stone<br>
        To know my fate ain’t mine to choose<br>
        To lose my joy along with all I own<br>
        But to sing—the blues</p>
 
    <p>I don’t want to make you happy<br>
    I don’t want to hear your answer<br>
    I don’t want to hope it’ll turn out fine<br>
    I don’t want to plan the future<br>
    I don’t want to look behind me<br>
    I don’t want to keep on trine<br>
        All I want is for the wind that’s blown<br>
        To carry off any last good news<br>
        To know that sorrow is all I’ve known<br>
        And to sing—the blues    </p>

    <h2>Jericho</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Someone Else's Blues, 2014</i>Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#someoneElsesBlues_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>From inside the walls through the chambers and halls every call falls in deafening echo<br>
    Back onto the ears of the ones still in here whom the system condemned from the get-go<br>
    Hear tell of a place where no man has a face on account of his case was mishandled <br>
    Its called Jericho it’s the old status quo it was left long ago undismantled</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come when each voice raised as one<br>
        Will erupt from the crowd in a shattering sound<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and the warden will know <br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>They step off the trains and they’re put into chains and their names’re all changed into numbers<br>
    It’s all an attempt to make someone exempt from recognizing himself in another <br>
    The one who presides presumes to decide that who lives and who dies is up to him<br>
    Its based on the facts but the conclusions, they lack all the feelings they used to get to em<br>
    <br>
    (The political line that claims to be tough on crime and aims to punish the worst and the baddest<br>
    Has foregone the facts and’s just trine to keep blacks in a permanent second-class status<br>
    The government funds for education and low-income housing’s out-moded<br>
    While the money’s increased for cops and police, and the population of prison’s exploded)</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come without lifting a gun<br>
        Every voice will the edge of the city surround<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and the governors will know<br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>They’re poor to begin they’re taught they can’t win when they’re brought in it aint to bear witness<br>
    They’re deemed by a judge unfit to be much call it justice but its just a business<br>
    The one who presides claims that his eyes have been cleansed by their own colorblindness  <br>
    He and the rest all think they’re doin their best, and that the age of racism’s behind us<br>
    (But the ones on lock-down are mostly black or they’re brown and they’re poor and they’re misrepresented<br>
    And as far as the count on who’s been in and out–the numbers are unprecedented)</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come where by ceasing to run<br>
        We’ll not be turned back nor told to turn round<br>
        And the trumpets will blow, and the judges will know <br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>The prisons’re run by the corporations so your freedom’s the price of a profit<br>
    And no one’s to blame cause to them it’s a game, trying to fill in a bottomless pocket<br>
    The cycle won’t break it accounts for mistakes and it knows that you’ll make and repeat em<br>
    But the killers ain’t killed as long as they’re killed and the prisons’re as filled as they need em</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come when the songs that we’ve sung<br>
        Will within every breast alight and resound<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and the hangman will know<br>
        That the walls of Jericho must come down</p>
 
    <p>They’re brought into here to do what it ain’t clear to where no one can say what he’s seeing<br>
    They’re hated and scorned and their cries are ignored and they won’t hear the words human being<br>
    (Jesus spake from the hill “go and do what you will, but treat thyself as thou wouldst others<br>
    Is it so hard to see that you do unto to me what you do to the least of my brothers?”)<br>
    Hear tell of a spot where a man is forgot spite of whether or not they convict him<br>
    Its called Jericho it’s the place that you go from the criminal into the victim</p>
 
    <p>But the day soon shall come where by beating the drum<br>
        Every voice from the silence shall again be unwound<br>
        And the trumpets will blow and all you will know <br>
        Is that the walls of Jericho have come down</p>

    <h2>Someone Else's Blues</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Someone Else's Blues, 2014</i>Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#someoneElsesBlues_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Last time we talked we didn’t say too much I don’t guess<br>
    Something about how maybe we were finally getting to be a little bit too old for this<br>
    There was a little bit of time yet then wrapped around your wrist <br>
    The end of the autumn in a November evening mist<br>
        But you should’ve seen your face that day it was the color of the gentle rose you wore in your lapel<br>
        While the captain raised a clamour and the widow clanged that old church-bell<br>
        They say lightning never strikes the same place twice<br>
        And I’m standing here thinking if it struck anywhere, just once would be more than nice<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            And we did not both know what we’ve both been through<br>
            I guess then I’d just be in someone else’s shoes<br>
            I guess I’d be singing someone else’s blues</p>
 
    <p>Your eyes once in a fleeting car moved past, and I swear I only caught the briefest glimpse<br>
    You did not see my standing on that street-corner to which by the way I have not been back since<br>
    I used to go out wandering from drug- to department-store<br>
    thinking maybe that I was the one who’s not who he sposed to be anymore<br>
        But it’s not an easy thing I don’t guess, to know you were not born alone and when<br>
        You can still go anywhere but you can’t go home again<br>
        They say lightning never twice the same place strikes<br>
        They say there’s no difference at all between some look alikes<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            What would there be left for us to misconstrue<br>
            Two vacant seats now in that old church pew<br>
            For someone else to sit with someone else’s blues</p>
 
    <p>Tomorrow we’re gone, at least today we’re still here<br>
    And you can still see the sun in that mud-puddle of yours that you call a mirror<br>
    Remember the time we got so turned around and ended up in some old playhouse?<br>
    And before the last act we both left to let the midnight river serenade us?<br>
        Come out, come out, wherever you are, the children scream<br>
        The games they play reminding us that this is not just some crazy dream<br>
        They say lightning never twice strikes the same place<br>
        As though when you try to repeat, all you do is erase<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            And we had not drifted the older we grew<br>
            I guess then I wouldn’t be here trying to choose<br>
            Now between mine and someone else’s blues</p>
 
    <p>Those were the days of the wind and the rain<br>
    The only difference is that now, well, they’re exactly the same<br>
    I sent you a letter a while back just to see how you are<br>
    And can you still play piano on that old worn out guitar<br>
        But you should’ve seen your face that day it looked not a thing like mine<br>
        Why’s it always the common sense that says it’s alright to just be yourself sometimes<br>
        Lightning never strikes the same place twice, they say<br>
        But even if it did they might not believe that anyway<br>
            If I were not me, and you were not you<br>
            Not I would not want not to not be not you<br>
            The hardest part about lovin you<br>
            Is that it has never been that hard to do</p>

    <p>You will know her by her eyes<br> 
    that will see right through your disguise<br>
    You will know by the way that the room falls away After she walks through the door<br>
    That for all that you’ve said about love’s being dead You’re not sure you believe anymore<br>
        And should you decide that not to have tried<br>
        Would afterwards only upset you inside<br>
        Don’t come crying to me, wanting to see, as if there could be any doubt<br>
        Whether that was the girl I was telling you bout</p>
 
    <p>You will know her by her voice<br>
    that will ask but will leave you no choice<br>
    You will know by the wish that she beckons you with By the way she says please to your lighter<br>
    That even if she says no, that she don’t want to go She don’t want you not to invite her<br>
        And should you admit it’d’ve been much better to quit<br>
        Before you went and got yourself all mixed up with it<br>
        I won’t say I was right, and I won’t pick no fight, but you know that I might have to shout<br>
        That that was the girl I was telling you bout</p>
 
    <p>You will know her by her hands<br>
    that not even she understands<br>
    You will know by the length of time that it takes To collect yourself after she’s left you<br>
    That you gave up too much in exchange for a touch That never consoled or caressed you<br>
        And if now and then you think you might do it again<br>
        If only this time to be prepared for the end<br>
        Well I guess that’s too bad you can’t want what you have but you know that I’m glad you found out<br>
        That that was the girl I was telling you bout</p>

    <p>Met a lady at a party she was hardly my type<br>
    But she invited me closer and I said, alright<br>
    Underscored me, ignored me, and she bored me to tears<br>
    But of all gazes hers was the gentlest</p>
 
    <p>Had me over got me sober even gave me a key<br>
    As she pulled the rug out from under me<br>
    Tried to sit up tried to get up to pick up the debris<br>
    But the odds they were stacked up against us</p>
 
    <p>Well you know me, Mr. Wait-and-see,<br>
        Mr. Cant-you-please-be-somewhat-kinder<br>
        As I’ll know by the sun when the morning has come<br>
        I will know my true love when I find her</p>
 
    <p>I been put up, I been stood up, been let up and let down<br>
    I been told to pick up and get out of town<br>
    Rejected, disrespected, and neglected so oft<br>
    I can’t tell anymore if you know me</p>
 
    <p>At the station congregations destinations unknown<br>
    Either tell me you love me or leave me alone<br>
    Among maestros in her plainclothes while the train pulls away<br>
    She says you don’t have to pay what you owe me</p>
 
    <p>Well you know me, Mr. wait-and-see<br>
        Mr. there-is-no-joy-separate-from-sorrow<br>
        And just like I would trade every heart for a spade<br>
        For yesterday I’d give all my tomorrows</p>
 
    <p>Well it’s lonely having only your memory to keep<br>
    As though I’d awakened to find that I was asleep<br>
    In the darkness cold and heartless will you part with your half<br>
    Whose hands were the words that you whispered with</p>
 
    <p>Was I dreaming, am I reading too much meaning into it?<br>
    Did you intend what you offered before you withdrew it<br>
    Do you miss me? Dismiss me? Would you kiss that mouth now<br>
    Whose words were the hands that I begged you with?</p>
 
    <p>Well you know me, Mr. Wait-and-see<br>
        Mr. upright-with-impeccable-posture<br>
        As you’ll not know the word for the thing you’ve endured<br>
        You’ll not know your true love til you’ve lost her</p>

    <p>Matthew he’s a friend of mine, used to put him up from time to time<br>
    Used to lend him nickles, quarters, dimes and dollars<br>
    Never had too much to say, went step by step and day by day<br>
    But soon every man must stray from what he fallers</p>
 
    <p>He always did alright in school never made the team but he played it cool<br>
    Each exception only breaks the rule it learns on<br>
    One day he got the thought to leave, shoved all his tricks in up his sleeve<br>
    He told them all one day they’d see he’d be gone</p>
 
    <p>Matthew, where are you?<br>
        Matthew, where are you?<br>
        Matthew, where are you?<br>
            Where are you?</p>
 
    <p>Can’t be sure but last I heard he was in a psychiatric ward<br>
    And he’d only sent home word so he could blame ya<br>
    Return address said San Marcos, letter said he was headed for the coast<br>
    Anywhere, he said, that’s nowhere close to Pennsylvania</p>
 
    <p>I’d know him now no more than you, couldn’t find him if I wanted to<br>
    I tried it once, without a clue to guide me<br>
    Just followed in his footsteps some, tried to get behind the sun<br>
    But just got lost without someone beside me</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>You left your home and left no trace for supper they still set your place<br>
    Fold their hands and all say grace without you<br>
    Your father still sits up to dawn in his bathrobe with his porchlight on<br>
    And folks they say he carries on and on about you</p>
 
    <p>And LeeAnn she still thinks of you, wonders what you’ve been up to<br>
    Says I only wish I knew that he was breathin<br>
    And your mother she’s still sleeping sound six feet underneath the ground<br>
    And once a year they all gather round a grievin </p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Matthew, do you still recall comin here with me when we were small<br>
    You wrote your name up on the wall in marker<br>
    Matthew won’t you please come home or try to find a telephone<br>
    Cause the days are getting shorter now, and darker</p>
 
    <p>Matthew, are you cold tonight, can you find your way without the light<br>
    Do you see the star that’s shining right above you?<br>
    Matthew, can you keep em shut, your ears from hearing you know what<br>
    They know you’ll never need it but they love you,<br>
    I know you’ll never want it but I do, too</p>

    <p>My mother was a shadow, or so I’ve heard the story told<br>
    My father rode the saddle, he never came in from out the cold<br>
    And I was born one hazy midnight, into a blanket I was rolled<br>
    Left upon a stranger’s doorstep when I was fifteen minutes old<br>
        Folks think that if I could find em now, I’d want to see em, they presume<br>
        Well as far as I’m concerned, I say, </p>
 
    <p>Never again would be too soon<br>
            Never again would be too soon<br>
            Never again would be too soon</p>
 
    <p>I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve had to go and leave my home<br>
    Whether on account of cause I always was, or else cause I was never left alone<br>
    Seems like every town I come to now is like every other town I’ve known<br>
    I come just long enough to learn of one more thing I’ll never own<br>
        And somewhere tween the sweepin floors and getting beaten with the broom<br>
        I say if I come back here anymore, </p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Well I loved a girl in New Orleans, although her name I don’t recall<br>
    She was kind and good to me, I was no good to her at all<br>
    I remember one night we’d just come back in from a ball<br>
    She had taken my possessions and locked them in the hall<br>
        I asked my girl how long it’d be for she’d let me back into her room<br>
        Well as far as I’m concerned, she said,</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Well I found me a friendly Christian, said I could stay with him for cheap<br>
    Said there was only one condition under which that contract he would keep<br>
    Said I had to start to livin clean, said he’d test me every week<br>
    Told him not to worry tho, I could do it in my sleep<br>
        Things were fine til they got hard again, and he found my needle and my spoon<br>
        I asked him when he’d let me back, he said,</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I killed a man in Kansas, I killed one in Tennessee<br>
    Both times I was as sorry as a man could ever be<br>
    Somewhere on the highway the law apprehended me<br>
    For one I got life in prison, for the other the death penalty<br>
        I asked the Lord if when I died he meant to raise me from my tomb<br>
        And something in the silence said,</p>
        
        <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Well I don’t know who I’m talkin to, I gues it doesn’t matter now<br>
    Anyone with ears’ll do, if the timin will allow<br>
    I’m only trine to figure out if there’s some way out of this somehow<br>
    If I never asked for help before, well, I’m sorry, but I’m askin now<br>
        The warden says my time’s been moved, so now I’m due to die at noon,<br>
        So if you’re wondering when to pray for me</p>

    I told her so right from the start<br>
    Eager to unite, we fell right apart<br>
    I should’ve seen it coming</p>
 
    <p>Tried again though, the second time was worse<br>
    The world’s a stage, but you can’t rehearse<br>

    It had commercial industry and basketball<br>

    I ran away so often</p>

        He only asks me things I know, he says that it’s important, though<br>
        I wish instead of asking he would tell me what to do<br>
        He’s quite encouraging, as if he thought I could make anything<br>
        Besides another failed attempt at getting over loving you</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been looking at the stars, trying to learn the constellations, making observations<br>
    I know Orion by now, and Cassiopeia, and I’ve a pretty good idea where the big and little dippers are<br>
        But astronomy is not for me, as anyone with eyes can see<br>
        I could watch that sky until the midnight turned to blue<br>
        And even if I knew the myths, what would they only leave me with<br>
        But another failed attempt at getting over loving you?</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been smoking long cigars, I imported them from Cuba, from Barbados and Bermuda<br>
    I’m not sure I like the taste of them, the sticky burning flavor, tho I’m quite fond of the paper that they wrap them in<br>
        But who am I trying to kid? I don’t like smoking and I never did<br>
        And I don’t give one good Goddam about where my tobacco grew<br>
        And even if I smoked incessantly, what would it only ever be<br>
        But another failed attempt at getting over loving you?</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been reading Russian novels from the latter nineteenth century, mainly Tolstoy and Dostoevsky<br>
    Sometimes I think I feel the same way as the characters they mention, who love in violent passion and dismay<br>
        Who always seem to know what’s best, who get what they want and then get depressed<br>
        Who suffer, bleed, and fight and die in search of something true<br>
        But every time I reach the end, I realize all my reading’s been <br>
        Is another failed attempt at getting over loving you</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been seeking some vocation, I need a new bad habit, I’m afraid I still don’t have it yet<br>
    I’ve tried coin- and stamp collecting, chocolate and wine tasting, bicycle and horse-racing<br>
        But I bet the coins on a losing horse, the stamps I sent to you, of course<br>
        Along with all my letters and every chocolate that I knew<br>
        And the wine that used to fill my shelf, I drank it quickly by myself<br>
        In another failed attempt at getting over loving you</p>
 
    <p>Lately I’ve been listening to music, I’m learning the piano, I’m really not that good, tho<br>
    I can play a couple major chords, a few scales in the minor, I find the latter kinder to me<br>
        But what is all my practice for? I’m not improving, of that I’m sure<br>
        And I don’t know the song to play that has my kind of blues<br>
        And even if I found it out, what would I have to sing about<br>
        But another failed attempt at getting over loving you?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Someone Else's Blues, 2014</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#someoneElsesBlues_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Other day I got a phone call from a friend of mine,<br>
    Friend I ain’t seen in the longest time<br>
    Said he’s passin through town, like to pay me a visit<br>
    He says, you’re not busy, Sam, it’s not inconvenient is it?<br>
        I said, Busy? Boy it has been a while<br>
        I ain’t been busy since the late 1990s</p>
 
    <p>I said when’ll you be here, he says, One day or the next<br>
    Says, how bout when I’m close I shoot you a text<br>
    I said, What? He says, I’ll send a text-message<br>
    I said, And what’s that, exactly?—Sounds impressive<br>
        He says don’t tell me you don’t get text messages<br>
        I said, of course I do—post man brings em all the time</p>
 
    <p>He says, What’ve you been doing man, where’ve you been<br>
    Don’t you know what year it is? It’s 2014!<br>
    Now I don’t mean to startle you, but I’ll make no apology<br>
    But there’s a thing we’ve got now it’s called modern technology<br>
        I tell him I’ve heard of that—science fiction and whatnot<br>
        Gene splicing—animal cloning—drone strikes</p>
 
    <p>He says Not all of it’s bad for your information<br>
    Some of it’s improved our communication<br>
    I say, And how’s that?—he says, Well, for instance<br>
    Like you and me here, we’re talkin long distance<br>
        I asked him where he was calling me from <br>
        He said he’s sittin on the toilet in an airplane<br>
        Flying over the Atlantic ocean at a cruising altitude of 22,000 feet</p>
 
    <p>He says cell phones make it easier to keep in touch<br>
    With friends you don’t see or hear from much<br>
    Then he accuses me of being a reclusive-type<br>
    Then he says, Hang on a minute, I’ve got to wipe<br>
        I wonder at what point does information<br>
        Become too much information</p>
 
    <p>A minute later he comes back on<br>
    Picks right back up with the thread he’s been on<br>
    Says it’s also made working a breeze<br>
    I can talk to whomever wherever whenever I please<br>
        I made the mistake of asking him what line of work he was in nowadays<br>
        He says he’s a telemarkerter for Verizon Wireless<br>
        Cell phone salesman—spokesperson</p>
 
    <p>Well at no promptin of mine he starts to striking a deal<br>
    Lays it on me, goes into his spiel<br>
    He says, Do you ever find that your signal’s weak<br>
    And you’re getting cut off every time you try to speak?<br>
        I said what signal? I’m talking to you on a landline<br>
        Rotary telephone, circa 1948</p>
 
    <p>He says, Now hold the phone—let me get this straight,<br>
    You don’t even have a cell phone, am I hearing you right?<br>
    I’m about to respond when he says, Hold the line<br>
    I’m getting a call on the other line<br>
        Talk about getting cut off—<br>
        seems sometimes good reception’s not about where you’re talkin<br>
        but who you’re talkin to</p>
 
    <p>I tell him to call me back, he asks for my number<br>
    I said You’re the one who called me, remember?<br>
    I asked him how he found me after all this time<br>
    He says he looked me up in the phone book—online<br>
        I said man, I remember when the yellowpages were actually yellow<br>
        And actually pages, too!</p>
 
    <p>Well I hang up and wait for him to call me back<br>
    And I’m waiting a while, a whole month, in fact<br>
    One day the phone rings, it’s my old pal<br>
    He says, Sorry about that, I been tied up a while<br>
        Talking to friends, relatives, callin up strangers<br>
        Makin sales</p>
 
    <p>First thing he asks me is did I get his parcel<br>
    I’m about to say no when I hear the doorbell<br>
    Sure enough it’s the postman right on time,<br>
    He’s got a package for me, shows me where to sign<br>
        And it’s a cell phone, complete with phone, charger, instruction manual,<br>
        Service guide, return policy, insurance policy, etcetera…</p>
 
    <p>I said what’s all this, he says No need to thank me,<br>
    But welcome, at last, to the twentyfirst century<br>
    He says now I don’t have to sit at home<br>
    Whenever I want to use my telephone<br>
        He says you’re a free man, liberated from the cord<br>
        Welcome to the world of wireless</p>
 
    <p>I ask him how much am I gonna have to pay<br>
    To live like him in the technology age?<br>
    He says it varies but it’s likely to cost<br>
    Anywhere between thirty and a hundred bucks<br>
        That’s per month, though, he says—but just think of the benefits!<br>
        Unlimited minutes, roaming, plus texting</p>
 
    <p>I open the box, remove the packaging foam<br>
    There’s nothing inside even looks like a phone<br>
    Just a slab of metal the size of a bar of soap<br>
    I said, You are kidding me, right, I hope<br>
        Where do you aim your mouth on this thing?<br>
        Which end is the listening end? Durn thing doesn’t even have buttons on it!</p>
 
    <p>Well he explains to me how to turn it off and on<br>
    Gets into an explanation that’s a little overdrawn<br>
    All about how its not just a telephone<br>
    Its also a camera, a computer, a thousand things in one<br>
        You can record a video and send it in an email with a message attached<br>
        And you don’t even have to get out of bed—talk about shared experience</p>
 
    <p>Well I tell him I appreciate everything he’s sayin,<br>
    But I just can’t buy in to this game he’s playin<br>
    And I certainly don’t understand the attraction<br>
    To a device that can only cause you more distraction<br>
        Make you a rude theater-goer, an even worse driver<br>
        Pretty clumsy pedestrian, too</p>
 
    <p>I tell him, don’t get me wrong, I’m not ungrateful<br>
    I guess there’s a couple ways this could be useful<br>
    I tell him I got a door in here that’s always swingin open<br>
    I been meaning for a while to prop it open with something<br>
        This looks like it’d be just about the right size<br>
        Make a good paper-weight, too     </p>

    <h2>Ruth</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Ruth was married in the days of yore, at the altar made on the threshingfloor<br>
    A man said, “Will you take my hand? Will you wear my weddingband?<br>
    Will you say you love me evermore?”<br>
    Ruth said, “Yes,” even though she wasn’t sure; she knew that men are often insecure<br>
    That night they went to bed, when she woke up he was dead<br>
    She cursed him for what he’d promised her: he’d said,</p>
                <p>Whither thou goest, I will go, whither thou lodgest I will lodge<br>
                Thy people shall be my people, thy God my God<br>
                What thou wouldst have me do, I would d<br>
                Where thou diest, there will I also die; when no more tears are left to cry<br>
                Let it ring out through the land, your wish is my command<br>
                Just don’t send me away from you</p>
    <p>At the funeral, his mother wept and prayed, then when everyone was gone she stayed</p>
    The rain fell lightly down, all was quiet in the town,<br>
    Ruth was waiting on her in the glade<br>
    When she noticed, Ruth startled and almost fled; but the woman called her to her side instead<br>
    She said, “Come be at my side, all my sons have died—<br>
    My hopes for going on have turned to lead</p>
    
    <p>“Tell me, what am I supposed to do? If there’s anyone can help me tell me who<br>
    Is there anything that rhymes with a grief as deep as mine?<br>
    I get older but the pain is always new.”<br>
    For a whole week they knealt there without bread, without moving and without sleeping in a bed<br>
    And when the eighth day dawned, the woman said to Ruth, “Be gone!<br>
    What are you waiting for?” And then Ruth said,<br>
    
            <p>Chorus</p>

    <h2>Right Where We Left Off</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The last time you left, you told them goodbye<br>
    You told them you’d write, or call, or at least try<br>
    And they said, alright, they said, all our love,<br>
    And when you get back, we’ll pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>Will you remember my name? the way I’ll keep yours<br>
    Inside of my heart and soul and my kitchen drawers<br>
    Or some other place, somewhere it won’t get lost<br>
    So we can pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>If we could go back, or maybe go on ahead<br>
    If I could remember some of those lovely things we said,<br>
    Maybe that’d be alright, maybe that’d be enough<br>
    Maybe then we could pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>I wish I could fly, I wish I could swim<br>
    I wish I could do any of those things that remind me of him<br>
    I wish they’d come back at whatever the cost<br>
    I wish I could pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>Maybe there’d be a way, through some kind of grace<br>
    Where I could hold on to a light in this pointless chase<br>
    Where everything’d freeze every time you said ‘stop,’<br>
    Where we could pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>We’ll bust into that room, we’ll go back in time<br>
    We’ll show ourselves to ourselves and we’ll tell em everything’s gonna be just fine<br>
    And the record will play and the sound will be soft<br>
    And then we’ll pick up right where we left off</p>
    
    <p>Just like turning a page to write the next line<br>
    Or saving a word so you’ll have something to say next time<br>
    You got to hold on, there will be no pause<br>
    And then we’ll pick up right where we left off</pp>

    <h2>If They Could Only See Us Now</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>My love sends me roses cause she knows I’m allergic<br>
    She pulls off the petals and marks the box ‘urgent’<br>
    Then she stands in the doorway and makes no disturbance<br>
    Even the light seems to soften for her</p>

    <p>She used to come closer we used to be gentle<br>
    To say how I loved her was unsentimental<br>
    And everyone said we had so much potential<br>
    But nobody knew how unhappy we were</p>

    <p>I used to get sore about breaking a promise<br>
    I didn’t want love if it couldn’t be honest<br>
    But of all my regrets I’d have to say that the fondest<br>
    Is that I will never forget you again</p>

    <p>You were the deathbed and I was the funeral<br>
    You were a number and I was a numeral<br>
    I never thought once to think that unusual<br>
    Until I thought it over and over again</p>

    <p>And now that I have the advantage of hindsight<br>
    And all of my life has been cast in the limelight<br>
    I can see I was wrong but don’t know how to make right<br>
    All of the troubles you wear on your brow<br>
    If only I could endure what I’m made of<br>
    If I could explain what I was afraid of</p>

        <p>Maybe that’d be enough to complete us<br>
        To hear from those who know that they need us<br>
        Just what they would think if they could only see us now</p>
 
    <p>Sometimes the day feels like a tedious project<br>
    A striving one tries for without any object<br>
    Without even laws or so much as a precept<br>
    To steer you or guide you or lead you back home</p>

    <p>You have to make do with what you’ve been given<br>
    Say that you meant to be where you were driven<br>
    Pretend you’re content with the life that you’re living<br>
    And maybe they’ll promise to leave you alone</p>

    <p>You said you were sick and I hoped you’d get better<br>
    I wrote you a song in the form of a letter<br>
    And your father wrote back and said, You’d better forget her<br>
    Whoever this is that you think that you are</p>

    <p>I thought what’s forbidden was all that’s worth loving<br>
    I thought he was kidding, didn’t know he was bluffing<br>
    You take the long shot and you’ll end up with nothing<br>
    His postscript I kept like the pain of a scar</p>

    <p>But after a while I spose you get used to<br>
    Knowing the things that used to confuse you<br>
    And even the habits to which they introduced you<br>
    Begin to seem like you need them somehow<br>
    If only I had a little more imagination<br>
    If I could withstand any duller sensation</p>

        <p>Or maybe if they would only heed us<br>
        Whenever we told them to please believe us<br>
        Perhaps they would hear if they could only see us now</p>

    <p>The anguish pours out in a language of nonsense<br>
    The present and future are both in the past tense<br>
    And history sits on the rim of a sequence<br>
    It cannot acknowledge and will not restart</p>

    <p>What is the point though, of making distinctions?<br>
    Between an injustice and just an extinction<br>
    There’s only a ballet of juxtapositions<br>
    And all of the dancers are moving apart</p>

    <p>The prophets are drafting their new manifestos<br>
    Leaving them published in coffeeshop windows<br>
    And sprayed on the backsides of boxcars whose cargoes<br>
    Are headed for a junkyard outside of Tucson</p>

    <p>Musicians are musing composing their movements<br>
    Jesters suggesting digestive amusements<br>
    To nobles bequeathing their thrones to a nuisance<br>
    Who will sell his own birthright before he moves on</p>

    <p>And when it comes down to the easiest option<br>
    To simply proceed without care or precaution<br>
    To throw up your hands at the back of the auction<br>
    And say that you’ll pay it back some day somehow<br>
    Will you remind me of the original prices<br>
    We paid to be left to our own devices</p> 

        <p>They said not to snap at the hands that feed us<br> 
        Sometimes I wonder how they would treat us<br>
        And what they would think if they could only see us now</p>

    <p>She never wore cotton she always wore satin<br> 
    When I first met her, she only spoke latin<br>
    And she made me promise to let nothing happen<br>
    I couldn’t undo or take back if I did</p>

    <p>You’ve taken advice from your supposed superiors<br>
    Whose practiced experience would not stoop to hear yours<br>
    You’ve learned every inch of all the interiors<br>
    But your nakedness somehow remains rather well hid</p>
 
    <p>I lived for a year as the ghost of an attic<br>
    Seeking a way that was more democratic<br>
    Screaming lost verbs in a downpour of static<br>
    Beneath a large hole I had carved in the roof</p>
 
    <p>And then I awoke as from a terrible nightmare<br>
    Groping the darkness and tangled in your hair<br>
    Murmuring echoes I recall reading somewhere<br>
    That was about when I parted with Truth</p>
 
    <p>As the voices of angels surround the cathedrals<br>
    And stand with the peasants who begin the upheavals<br>
    And teach it was goods that gave birth to the evils<br>
    With which we’ve been dealing our whole lives til now</p>

        <p>Will you recall why it was that we came here<br>
        And what we are doing inside this container<br>
        What were the words we were told that would ease us<br>
        Angel, joseph, mary, jesus,<br>
        What would they think if they could only see us now?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>My baby called me up lastnight, asked me if I felt alright<br>
    I said I’m okay, she said, alright, I’ll be there in an hour<br>
    She picked me up and took me to, every bar along the avenue<br>
    I tried to say when I was through, but it wasn’t in my power</p>
 
    <p>By the time the morning rolled around it seemed we’d been through half the town<br>
    I drunk so much I thought I’d drown if I didn’t die of thirst<br>
    She looked at me said aint this fun, and to think the weekend’s just begun<br>
    I said, now wait just a minute, hon, I got to break it to you first</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t know what you’re taking that keeps you going like you been<br>
    Coffee, cocaine, benzadrine or some amphetamine<br>
    But my energy is finite and it’s darn well near expired<br>
    And you know I hate to tell you, but my darling, I am tired</p>
 
    <p>Next morning she’s as good as new, got ten thousand new things to do<br>
    And every one she puts me through like it’s a test for me<br>
    Wants to run a race and ride her bike, swim cross the river and take a hike<br>
    And everything she says it like its as easy as can be</p>
 
    <p>Politely, I try to suggest that maybe we could just take a rest<br>
    Stop a while and catch our breath, or take a nap, at least<br>
    I just need a place to rest my head, don’t even need to be a bed<br>
    Just dig a hole and call me dead, but let me rest in peace</p>
 
    <p>Now I ain’t exactly lazy and in fact I work quite hard<br>
    I’m out of bed fore sunrise and I come home well past dark<br>
    I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and I’ll never be retired<br>
    But I ain’t exactly kidding when I tell you I am tired</p>
 
    <p>We made it home at half past three and right as I’m about to fall asleep<br>
    My babe says babe make love to me, and how could I refuse<br>
    We made it til the sun was high and the time for sleep had passed us by<br>
    I felt like I was gonna die if I didn’t cut her loose</p>
 
    <p>So I got dressed she said, What’s wrong, I said, I gotta be a getting on<br>
    She said, Wait, I said, So long, and climbed down from her arms<br>
    She said don’t you care for me? I said, I do, but can’t you see<br>
    Exhaustion, it breeds apathy, and your love’s bound to do me harm</p>
 
    <p>Now I’m tired of the homestead and I’m tired of the road<br>
    And I’m so tired of being tired I’m just about a ready to explode<br>
    Just a quiet place and darkness is all that I desired<br>
    From the moment that I met you all I been is well past tired</p>
 
    <p>Well, when I finally got a chance to sleep, I slept quite fast and hard and deep<br>
    Never mind the counting sheep, I just went out like a light<br>
    I slept for days and weeks and months, slept through my birthday more than once<br>
    I slept through all the arguments I might’ve had to fight</p>
 
    <p>Through earthquake fire flood and more, everything come knocking at my door<br>
    I slept right through the third world war and woke up all alone<br>
    I wandered through abandoned scenes in a vacant town among my dreams<br>
    To an empty port where a shanty leans and nobody is home</p>
 
    <p>Now if anyone can hear me, if there’s anybody left<br>
    That ain’t packed up in a graveyard waiting for a rest<br>
    I used to be so tired, but to sleep was my mistake—<br>
    If I could do it all again I’d wish for strength to stay awake</p>

    <p>Yonder she walks overtop of the rocks,<br>
    and every so often she thoughtfully stops<br>
    To untie her shoes, and to pull off her socks<br>
    Her beauty abounds beyond measure; I cannot handle the pressure<br>
    For even if somehow I<br>
    Could but capture her eye<br>
    And only to tell her, “I’m sorry—goodbye,”<br>
    There’d still be no way for to stand or to stay<br>
    For I’d not know what name by<br>
    which she goes to address her</p>
    
    <p>She carries her clothes and the wind her hair blows<br>
    And the ocean beside her it ebbs and it flows<br>
    Erasing her footprints and kissing her toes<br>
    As she tenderly wades through the mosses; she don’t know the pain that she causes<br>
    For even if I was sure<br>
    Of the sly conjecture<br>
    That what I feel for her is love, plain and pure<br>
    I’d still have to start<br>
    With a half-broken heart<br>
    That hopes, bears, believes and endures<br>
    Despite how all of its gains become losses</p>

    <p>Beneath the salt-waves, her fair body she bathes<br>
    And the seagulls above her observe her charades<br>
    Strongly she swims, to dive deeply, she saves<br>
    In her lungs, all the air she can gather; that it won’t last for long doesn’t matter<br>
    For even if I could change<br>
    Or only just rearrange<br>
    The conditions by which I’m made free in my chains<br>
    She still would beseech<br>
    Me and be out of reach<br>
    Of the arms that when she was in range<br>
    Could’ve swore that they had her</p>

    <p>From the watery deep she sings me to sleep<br>
    And slowly become I her question to keep<br>
    In my dreams she accosts me and asks me to speak<br>
    From inside the bounds of her clutches, she tells me to walk without crutches<br>
    And tho I’m to blame<br>
    For remaining the same<br>
    Despite and because of the size of the pain<br>
    She still won’t relent<br>
    Won’t requite or resent<br>
    And you can’t quite prevent how insane<br>
    She turns everyone that she touches</p>

    <p>You can stay in the stable, Cain, if you are able<br>
    And if you ain’t ready I’m sure that she’ll understand<br>
    She loves them all equal, the strong and the feeble<br>
    But you know to a new friend she prefers second-hands</p>

    <p>Her heart it is golden and her fingers are porcelain<br>
    And her hair ravenblack flows as long as her veins<br>
    You can borrow a dollar and from the fence you can call her<br>
    By any one of her ten-thousand-twenty-two names</p>

    <p>When the time comes to leave her, she will ask you to stay<br>
    And you’ll have to be honest, and just say you ain’t strong<br>
    Course I hope that you’re smarter than to put it that way<br>
    But whatever you tell her, you can’t make it too long</p>

    <p>She’ll sit in the chapel and chew on her apple<br>
    That somebody gave her, she didn’t see who<br>
    If you ask where it came from she’ll ask “Why, do you want some?<br>
    For the life of me, sweetheart, I thought it was you.”</p>

    <p>She lives in the country midst pastures of plenty<br>
    Where the wheat bravely staggers and the rye gently blows<br>
    When she needs a diversion she’ll make an excursion<br>
    To a place in the forest where nobody goes</p>

    <p>When you come to a clearing she will tell you to halt<br>
    And you’ll have to be honest and say you’re really surprised<br>
    And while you make your excuses and say it wasn’t your fault<br>
    Best be sure that you’re speaking with tears in your eyes</p>

    <p>Far from the centers she exits and enters<br>
    And stealthily glides midst the unnoticed crowds<br>
    You can follow her shadow, pretending she had no<br>
    Reason for drawing you underneath of her cloud</p>

    <p>She’s cold as a crystal and she carries a pistol<br>
    That carries six bullets she fires at will<br>
    When she blows you her kisses, know that she never misses<br>
    And you’d already be dead if just lookin could kill</p>

    <p>When she tells you her story and it runs your frame cold<br>
    Well, you’ll have to be honest and just say what you thought<br>
    Tho she’s only a child, she’s already too old<br>
    To remember that all that she knows she’s been taught</p>

    <p>The district attorney made a hell of a journey<br>
    One midsummer’s Sunday at the end of july<br>
    Even pulled by a bloodhound there was nothing to be found<br>
    In the end he just told her he only came to say hi</p>

    <p>Several months later in the onset of winter<br>
    When the lakewater surface had but frozen part way<br>
    A man was out huntin and he stumbled on something<br>
    That made him feel that he’d seen enough blood for one day</p>

    <p>When they came to arrest her with their shotguns unsheathed<br>
    Crying “Keep your eyes careful, boys, she needs to be watched,”<br>
    She came out on the porch and said, “Will you poor bastards, please,<br>
    Say what you think you could take from me I ain’t already lost?”</p>

    <p>You don’t have to sell it but that’s how they tell it<br>
    Hithers her homestead and yonders her grave<br>
    You could put up a statue, a figure of virtue<br>
    And Adonis-madonna for all the damn that she gave</p>

    <p>Born to an orphan who was born to an orphan<br>
    In east Oklahoma where she lived till she died<br>

    <h2>The Ballad of Abraham and Isaac</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 7</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>God called to Abraham, said “Abraham, my son,”<br>
    Abraham said, “Here I am—what is it you want done?”<br>
    Said, “Abraham, the time has come, go and get me your dearest son, And by tomorrow’s setting sun—<br>
    I want you to offer him up to me.”</p>

    <p>Well Abraham he went on home, and he sat down to his supper<br>
    Sarah asked him what he’d done, as he looked so pale and sober<br>
    He said, “I’ve done nothing, that’s just it, I must be dreaming or getting sick I think I just need to lie down quick!”<br>
    And he got up from the table</p>

    <p>That night he did not sleep a wink, but he lay in his bed tryin<br>
    The only thoughts that he could think, were of his young son’s lonesome dyin<br>
    For his life he couldn’t understand why it had to be by his own hand, why this had been his Lord’s command—<br>
    He couldn’t think of any reason</p>

    <p>Next morning, early, he arose—well before the sun had risen<br>
    Put on his hat and his morning clothes—brought along a knapsack with him<br>
    Then he stole into Isaac’s room, Brought him out beneath the moon And like a corpse, fresh for the tomb--<br>
    Isaac went on sleepin</p>

    <p>“Lord,” he said, “I’m beggin you—if ever you’ve been with me<br>
    For what I am about to do, I hope you will forgive me,”<br>
    Then Isaac, who had just woke up Said, “Forgive you, father? But for what?” He said, “Son, you know I’d tell you but—<br>
    Myself, I do not know yet.”</p>

    <p>Then Abraham he told his son of a journey he was makin<br>
    He said “If you choose I’ll let you come, but it has no destination<br>
    Bring up a mule and pack a tent, A rope, some tinder and some flint,” And obediently, Isaac went—<br>
    To do as he was bidden</p>

    <p>Then Abraham to Isaac called, “Isaac my dear son,”<br>
    Isaac answered, “Here I am—what is it you want done?”<br>
    He said, “Isaac, now the time has come Go and get me my Remington, the very best of all my guns—<br>
    And offer it up to me.”</p>

    <p>Well the rode until their shadows grew much taller than their figures<br>
    The frigid autumn evening blew the leaves against dead fixtures<br>
    And when the sky had turned to red Abraham to Isaac turned his head “Gather up some wood,” he said<br>
    “Here’s where we’ll build the altar.”</p>

    <p>“What will be our offering?” Isaac asked unto his father<br>
    “A lamb to kill we didn’t bring.” Abe said, “We needn’t bother,<br>
    What we brought will be just fine, Now hurry up, there ain’t much time,” And while Isaac went for some wood to find—<br>
    Abe loaded up his rifle</p>

    <p>Isaac left and then came running back, crying, “Father! Please come quickly,<br>
    I’ve spied a deer in a bramble patch—he’s caught up well and thickly,”<br>
    Abraham said, “Show me where,” Isaac took him, said “Right there,” And sure enough, within a snare—<br>
    A healthy deer was struggling.</p>

    <p>Abraham said, “Lord, my God—if ever you’ve been with me<br>
    For what I am about to do, I hope you will forgive me<br>
    I don’t pretend to understand Why you gave me that command But if I do or don’t I’m damned—<br>
    This is my situation.”</p>

    <p>And sayin that he raised his gun and laid his cheek against the barrel<br>
    In his range were both his dearest son and the deer so wild and feral<br>
    For a moment he observed the scene Like a man who can’t decide between Who needs someone to intervene—<br>
    To make his decision for him.</p>

    <p>But from the sky no angel came to stay his quaking finger<br>
    No spirit Abraham could name brought his hot hand to the trigger<br>
    And midst the depths of his deepest doubt “Shoot, father!” Isaac shouted out And from the woods one shot rang out—<br>
    Followed closely by another.</p>

    <p>And whether he first shot the deer, thinking that would be sufficient<br>
    And afterwards shot the boy when he realized that it wasn’t<br>
    Or whether he first killed his son, then himself when he realized what he’d done Or fired twice at the setting sun—<br>
    To this day, there is no telling.</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The kettle is screaming from its place on the stove<br>
    Still dark but it’s morning, Mary’s in her bathrobe<br> 
    Those boys better wake up, she says to herself<br>
    But she knows they ain’t sleeping—no, they’re somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>She pours out the coffee, and she throws on a quilt<br> 
    Steps out on the front porch that her late husband built<br>
    And as she stares at the ocean, she recalls how she felt<br>
    To be a young woman who longed to be somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>But she’d married a sailor who’d married the sea<br>
    And she’d borne him three children uncomplainingly<br>
    And whenever they took sick she’d nurse them right back to health<br>
    By feeding them stories about somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>Then one day in November, her husband called All Aboard<br>
    For the very last time and was lost overboard<br>
    They brought her his jacket, his boots and his belt<br>
    Said, “He might not be drowned, ma’am, might just be somewhere else.”</p>

    <p>For ten days they waited, then they waited ten more<br>
    For his body or his clothing to wash up on shore<br>
    But it only got colder and the ice wouldn’t melt<br>
    So they finally concluded he was just somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>And her boys grew to manhood—tho much to her dismay<br>
    And despite how she urged them, they took up the old trade<br>
    First was lost near Tahiti, the second drowned way down south<br>
    The third his brothers went seeking, and wound up somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>They say not to lose hope, they say not to despair<br>
    Just because they don’t come back don’t mean they ain’t there<br>
    They say to have courage, you know but it hardly helps<br>
    When your heart is in one place and your love’s somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>The ships have come back now, they’re moored at the pier<br>
    And the sailors are drunk now, on their whiskey and beer<br>
    And upon barroom counters captains divvy their wealth<br>
    But the wives and the widows, aw, they’re somewhere else</p>
 
    <p>The Lord he may giveth and he may taketh away<br>
    But if you need a good reason, the Bible won’t say<br>
    And as she blows out her candle, and puts the book on the shelf<br>
    She thinks, “If God’s in his heaven, I must be somewhere else.</p>

    <p>Taxi lady, tell me where to—can I take you long the avenue?<br>
    You still lookin for that prince you said you knew? And does he still have your other shoe?<br>
    Taxi lady, I guess it’s been a while—I’m glad to see tho that you still ain’t lost your style<br>
    But say what happened to your winning smile? It used to be worth more than just a mile<br>
    Taxi lady, how’d you get to be so sad—you look just like you lost whatever chance you had<br>
    But nevermind you’ll see it ain’t that bad, once you’ve had a ride in my good ol taxi cab<br>
    Taxi lady, won’t you tell me what you want, expensive dinner at some four star restaurant?<br>
    To spend a whole night at the hotel Altamont? You name the date and I can take you if you want<br>
    Taxi lady, can I take you for a ride, up to the highway or the lonesome riverside<br>
    You seem like the kind of girl with nothing left to hide, I’m the kind of man with nothing left inside<br>
    Taxi lady, tell me where you’re comin from, it’s so cold tonight my hands are getting numb<br>
    I can’t tell you how many miles I’ve just come, not to get to you but just to anyone</p>

    <p>At the next stop take a right, then go down there right on through that trafficlight<br>
    You can circle the block a couple times it’s alright, but taxi, take me home tonight</p>

    <p>Taxi lady, well, now that you asked, I got lots of troubles all up buried in my past<br>
    I try to get away but this taxi ain’t too fast, seems like some of what is there is there to last<br>
    Taxi lady tell me how you been, you know I haven’t always driven this machine<br>
    I used to have a job I wrote songs for a queen, it was a lot like this if you know what I mean<br>
    Taxi lady, keep your change this one’s on me, you find me again and you can always ride for free<br>
    I ain’t scared of having no place to be, I’m just afraid of having no one to take with me<br>
    Taxi lady won’t you take the whole night off, we’ll go wherever you can possibly think of<br>
    And if by the end you still ain’t had enough I got a bottle waiting back in the garage<br>
    Taxi lady tell me what you got to lose, another evening settin at home with the blues<br>
    This ain’t no limosine but it’ll do for just a cruise, down past the marquis and the crowded avenues<br> 
    Taxi lady, say again where do you live, I hope it ain’t among that crowd I seen you with<br>
    Don’t say you’re sorry I don’t know what that is, I’m one of those whose done too much sinning to forgive</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Taxi lady, will you ever find your prince? I heard he lives up in those project tenements<br>
    You know I barely make enough to pay my rents, but I don’t want your money, I’ll just take your compliments<br>
    Taxi lady, how bout some other night, we’ll get together, we’ll do it right<br>
    Give me a signal but please make it bright; you put out your hand and I’ll put out my light<br>
    Taxi lady, I must bid thee now, adieu; I feel somehow that our acquaintanceship ain’t thru<br>
    I can’t tell you who to be or what to do, but there’s a thousand more out here tonight like you</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Failed Novels, 2014</i> Track 11</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#failedNovels_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Well I went to visit grandma just the other week,<br>
    she seemed so glad to see me doin well<br>
    She didn’t look so bad herself for a woman of her age,<br>
    that she was almost 93 you’d never tell</p>
 
    <p>Well we got to catchin up a bit as it had been a little while,<br>
    granny said she’d done a bit of traveling of late<br>
    I figured she meant around the house or down the road a little ways—<br>
    that was my first mistake</p>
 
    <p>Said she’d been all over Europe, all through England and through France,<br>
    said she’d swam across the Adriatic sea<br>
    Then she came back to the United States and she visited each one,<br>
    and then got home just in time for hostin me</p>
 
    <p>well every story that granny told me seemed a little more surprising than the last<br>
    til finally I had to interrupt her at some length<br>
    I said, Granny, I believe you, but I just have to ask<br>
    What is the secret to your strength?</p>
 
    <p>She said, “Aw, well that’s an easy one, you know I always watch my weight<br>
    And I’ve always kept my posture good so that I wouldn’t stoop<br>
    I take vitamins and exercise and every day I have one bowl<br>
    Of grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure blindness! It’ll make you whoop (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again</p>
 
    <p>Now I must say when granny said all this my curiosity was aroused,<br>
    I said, Now of what does this here said soup consist?<br>
    Before she even answered me she said, “Would you like a taste of some?”<br>
    I shrugged and said, “Well, if you insist.”</p>
 
    <p>Then she went over to the fridge and she pulled out a great big pot<br>
    That looked to be leftovers from the latest batch<br>
    And takin off the lid she exclaimed, “Darn—fresh out!<br>
    Not to worry though, we’ll just start again from scratch!”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure baldness! It’ll make you whoop (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again</p>
 
    <p>Well the first thing that she did was bring some water to a boil<br>
    Added salt and pepper and vinegar and a little gin<br>
    In another pan she heated up a little bit of olive oil<br>
    Then she cut up an onion and some veggies and threw em in</p>
 
    <p>Then while all of that was cookin she went out into the yard<br>
    Told me to keep an eye on that there bubbling broth<br>
    She came back in with a live hen, tossed it whole into the pot<br>
    Didn’t even kill it first or take it’s feathers off</p>
 
    <p>And before I could object, she had left the room again,<br>
    Went and gathered every soiled bedsheet in her home<br>
    And when all the laundry was collected she nonchalantly stirred it in<br>
    Said, “It’s like killing two birds with one stone!”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure arthritis! It’ll make you whoop! (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again!</p>
 
    <p>Well, when she had taken out her laundry and had hung it out to dry,<br>
    She said, and now we’ll add the noodles to the mix<br>
    But upon inspection of her pantry, not a morsel caught my eye<br>
    Granny looked and said, “Well aw—fiddlesticks!”</p>
 
    <p>Then a look came over granny that was at first desperate and then fierce<br>
    Then she snapped her fingers and said she knew just the thing<br>
    She said, “Well you’ve got shoes on,” I said, “Yes, and what of that?”<br>
    She said, “Well—get em off! We need them strings!”</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll take the paint off—it’ll make you whoop (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why it’ll almost make you young again!</p>
 
    <p>Well when everything was in there and it had simmered for a while,<br>
    Granny stirred it up and said it was almost done<br>
    Then she got me out a bowl and she got me out a spoon<br>
    And said, “I’ll bet you just can’t wait to try you some,”</p>
 
    <p>Now I’ve never been a one to treat my elders with disrespect<br>
    And I’ve never been one to deliberately seem rude<br>
    But after seeing what I had of those ingredients and all,<br>
    I should have hesitated to call what that was food</p>

    <p>So I said, Granny, I’m obliged, but I think I’m gonna pass,<br>
    She said, “Now, I don’t want to hear none of that there lip!”<br>
    She ladeled me a bowl and set it down and crossed her arms<br>
    I gulped and shut my eyes and took a sip of</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll clean you out—it’ll make you whoop! (Wahoo!)<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why, it’ll almost make you young again</p>
 
    <p>Well the next thing that I knew I was passed out cold upon the floor<br>
    Granny was standing over me, saying, “Do you know where you are?”<br>
    I said, “Go and get a doctor,” but she had no phone or car,<br>
    And so she carried me all the way to the E.R.</p>
 
    <p>Few days later I was better all laid up in my hospital bed,<br>
    The doctor said he’d never seen a case so bad<br>
    He said, “I mean it’s like you were poisoned or something!” I said, “Yeah, pretty much,”<br>
    He said, “Do you know what you ate?” I said, “All I had was</p>
 
    <p>Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll give you courage—it’ll make you whoop!<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Why it’ll almost make you young again!</p>
 
    <p>Well granny came to see me later on that afternoon<br>
    Brought me some flowers and some home-made medicine<br>
    She said, “I have no idea how you got so sick, but this here will cure you sure!”<br>
    I rolled my eyes, and said, “Here we go again—”</p>
 
    <p>Grandmas’ famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    Some say it’s a blessing, some say it’s a curse<br>
    Grandma’s famous chicken noodle soup<br>
    It’ll cure you—if it doesn’t kill you first!</p>

    And in between there I visited a lot of places, shook a lot of hands, saw a lot of faces<br>
    I got pretty close to some things you wouldn’t want to go near, I heard some things you’d probably not want to hear</p>
 
    <p>But of all the towns that I can recollect now there’s one I remember being different somehow<br>
    Cause there was this man, I don’t guess you’d doubt it, he did this thing, well let me tell you about it:<br>
    Well, it was a midsummer’s evening if I remember right, I’s hunting up a place where I could stay the night<br>
    And I came on a crossroads about a quarter past seven, only thing there’s a hotel and a tavern</p>
 
    <p>Well the door was open, and there was a candle burning, it wasn’t anything too fancy or nothing<br>
    But it looked like a place you might get a drink, have a spot to sit and some time to think<br>
    So I go on in, I’m the only one there, except for the bartender of course and two other guys there<br>
    And they was rough old boys, you should’ve seen em, so I go on up sit down in between em</p>
 
    <p>I say, “Busy night?” No one laughs; tender comes over he’s wiping a glass<br>
    He says, “I never seen you in here before,” I said, “That’s cause I never been in here before,”<br>
    He says, “Where you from?” I say, “Nowhere special,” he says, “Passin through, eh? Right on schedule…”<br>
    Well, we talked that way for a little while, neither one of the other two even crackin a smile</p>
 
    <p>Finally the bartender tells me that I look thirsty, I say, “Thanks, friend, I ain’t had a drink since Thursday,”<br>
    So he pours me a beer, I thank him for the service, he says, “You alright, man? You seem kinda nervous…”<br>
    Well I guess I must’ve been moving my eyes back and forth betwixt these two other guys<br>
    So I say, “What’s the story with these two fellas?” Tender perks up, says “Well, let me tell you</p>
 
    <p>“The man to your right is a righteous man, man I’d trust about as far as I can<br>
    He doesn’t say much that ain’t worth saying, but a word from him is a word worth saving<br>
    The man to your left’s a whole other story, belongs to his very own category<br>
    I don’t guess there’s much that man ain’t said, gainst friend or enemy, livin or dead—”</p>
 
    <p>As soon as he says that this bottle comes flying, the tender ducks and it breaks behind him<br>
    One of em threw it I couldn’t tell which, and then the other one called him an old son of a bitch<br>
    Then he says, “You wanna see something really funny?” I said “That all depends, what’ll it cost me?”<br>
    He says, “Nothin, just a minute of your time,” I say, “Alright, well that ought to be just fine,”</p>
 
    <p>He says, “Ask this fine young handsome gentleman,” and he’s pointing to the guy standing right across from him,<br>
    He says, “Ask him to tell you about that other fella, the one there sittin on the other side of ya,”<br>
    So I say, “Why? What for? What’ll happen?” he says, “Nothing probably,” and he starts laughin<br>
    I say, “I don’t get it,” he says, “Well I can see I’m borin ya, just don’t try telling me that I didn’t warn ya</p>
    
    <p>And then the phone rings and he walks off somewhere…</p>

    <p>So for a minute I paused, I just sat there drinkin, nobody’s talking and so I started thinking<br>
    I mean, what in the heck could be so hilarious about these two fellas, he can’t be serious<br>
    So I’m drinking, feeling a buzz, I ask the man to my right what his name was<br>
    He says “I’m Jake,” I said, “And who’s your brother?” He says, “For that you’re gonna have to ask my mother,”</p>
    
    <p>I said, “Alright, and where’s she?” he says he doesn’t know, points down the bar, says “My brother might, though,”<br>
    I said, “Alright, well this is getting exhausting,” So I go up to his brother and I practically accost him,<br>
    I say, “Howdy friend, putter there! Now what can you tell me bout that man down there?”<br>
    Well he shrugs some, and turns his back, he’s pouring out shots, knockin em back</p>

    <p>So I try again, I always been persistent, he resists me again, like he’s all against it<br>
    Finally the tender calls out, “Naw man, you can’t force it!—I know he drinks it faster than he pours it<br>
    But you just let him finish that there swaller, and you’ll see, he’ll begin to holler—”<br>
    Sure enough, no sooner had he set down his glass, he says: “Alright, I’ll tell you, but just cause you asked:<br>
    
    <p>He’s a no good long haired dirty yella double crossin son of a low-down lyin

    <h2>Ain't It a Pity?</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I went down to the chapel last easter morning,<br>
    Hadn’t been for a while, it seemed like a good time<br>
    I was counting on hearing a beautiful sermon<br>
    By the preacher there who’s an old friend of mine</p>
 
    <p>I’s a few minutes late, the service was crowded<br>
    An usher escorted me into my seat<br>
    Soon as I had sat down the sermon had started,<br>
    The next thing that I knew, I had fell fast asleep</p>
 
    <p>And while I was sleepin while the preacher was preachin<br>
    A most peculiar vision visited me<br>
    I dreamt that the person sittin beside me<br>
    Was none other than jesus of old galilee</p>
 
    <p>Well he put out his hand, and he said, “Nice to meet you,”<br>
    There wasn’t no halo hangin over his head<br>
    He looked old and tired and he smelled sorta pungent<br>
    As you’d imagine a man who just came back from the dead</p>
 
    <p>He wanted to know if I’d show him around some<br>
    And keep him a secret, he didn’t want to be seen<br>
    I agreed to his terms and he asked what the date was<br>
    I said, “It’s easter Sunday, 2014”</p>
 
    <p>It occurred to me then just what jesus was in for<br>
    Having never set foot within our day and age<br>
    He’d probably never seen a car or an airplane<br>
    Or watched a television or read the sportspage</p>
 
    <p>Well out of the church we two then proceeded<br>
    While the preacher in the pulpit was left carryin on<br>
    I asked old jesus what he thought of the sermon<br>
    He said he thought it had gone on too long</p>
 
    <p>We stepped outside into the city<br>
    Where the wind blew a newspaper right up to our feet<br>
    Jesus picked it up and he started to readin,<br>
    And the words that he said, he was bound to repeat, he said:</p>
 
    <p>Aint it a pity? Aint it a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    There’s still wars bein fought, there’s still people in chains<br>
    Aint it a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>Well we walked for a while through the slums and the alleys<br>
    Jesus took it all in like he’d seen it before<br>
    Healing the sick, feeding the hungry<br>
    Helping the needy, the grievin, the poor</p>
 
    <p>Somehow or other we made it to wall-street<br>
    Where we stood out like bums at a rich folks’ parade<br>
    Jesus pulled on the coat-tails of a shiny tuxedo<br>
    Asked the fella who wore it how his money was made</p>
 
    <p>Well the fella turned red and told us to get lost<br>
    He said, “That’s my business and none of your own!”<br>
    He said, “If I had a dollar to give every beggar<br>
    I’d be out of a job and out of a home!” Jesus said,</p>
 
    <p>Aint that a pity? Aint that a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    Sure the buildings are taller, but the people’s the same<br>
    Ain’t that a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>While jesus was talkin, the man lets out a whistle<br>
    And up comes this officer lookin servile and all<br>
    He says “What’s the trouble?” and the man points right at us<br>
    The officer makes us put our hands on the wall</p>
 
    <p>And while he is friskin, jesus starts talkin<br>
    Says, “You won’t get to heaven by buyin your way!”<br>
    When the officer heard that he started to beat him<br>
    Dragged us both to his squad car to haul us away</p>
 
    <p>Down at the courthouse they questioned and searched us<br>
    Took prints of our fingers and asked us our names<br>
    When I told them mine, they didn’t say nothing<br>
    When jesus said his, well they called him insane, jesus said,</p>
 
    <p>Aint that a pity? Aint that a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    To the people in charge the truth still sounds insane<br>
    Aint that a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>Well we went fore the judge who asked what our crime was,<br>
    The officer said we’s tryin to steal from the rich<br>
    He said he’d be doin both us a favor<br>
    Brought down his gavel, said the sentence was death, jesus said,</p>
 
    <p>Aint that a pity? Aint that a shame?<br>
    I’m gone two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed<br>
    They kill you once, if you come back, they’ll kill you again<br>
    Aint that a pitiful shame?</p>
 
    <p>Well when I awoke I was still in the chapel<br>
    The sermon was over, everyone had gone home<br>
    Except for one person way up in the front row<br>
    Who had his head bent and was prayin alone</p>
 
    <p>Well I got up to leave so as not to disturb him<br>
    I tried to be quiet so I wouldn’t be heard<br>
    But when I got to the front, and started to pass him<br>
    I couldn’t help overhearing some familiar words</p>
 
    <p>Aint it a pity? Aint it a shame?<br>
    It’s been two thousand years and the world hasn’t changed!<br>
    When I think of the violence that’s been done in christ’s name<br>
    Aint it a pitiful shame?</p>

    <h2>You Can't Get Any Poorer Than Dead</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Rich folks get—richer and richer<br>
    Sick folks get—sicker and sicker<br>
    And the gap between em gets—bigger and bigger<br>
    And the days go by—quicker and quicker</p>
    And everybody dies—sooner or later<br>
    Nobody comes out ahead<br>
    If you can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    You can’t be any poorer than dead<br>

    <p>Hired on Monday Tuesday I’m fired<br>
    Rent keeps getting higher and higher<br>
    Money keeps getting scarcer and scarcer<br>
    While my pantry keeps getting barer and barer<br>
    Somebody mustve made an error somewhere<br>
    Cause my own kids I can’t keep fed<br>
    I gotta remind em when they tell me they’re hungry <br>
    That you cant be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>

    <p>I tried to hide it but I guess its apparent<br>
    Nothing for my kids to hand down from my parents<br>
    Nothing to lose or to gain as inheritance<br>
    Save for maybe a hatred of arrogance<br>
    Last week I made out my last will and testament <br>
    And golly do you know what it said<br>
    It said you can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    And you can’t be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>
    
    <p>Population keeps increasing<br>
    Earth’s resources are near depletion<br>
    Our furthest limits we’re near to reachin<br>
    And the brakes of progress are hardly screechin<br>
    In a schoolhouse somewhere a teacher’s teachin<br>
    This is the observable trend<br>
    You can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive <br>
    And you can’t be any poorer than dead<br>

    <p>Chorus</p>

    <p>World is getting warmer and warmer<br>
    Soon it’ll be perpetual summer<br>
    With an ice-cube salesman on every corner<br>
    Sellin ice cubes at a hundred and a quarter<br>
    And I’ll take ten tho I can’t afford em<br>
    But what’s just a little more debt?<br>
    When you cant be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    You cant be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>Chorus</p>
    
    <p>Scientists are workin harder and harder<br>
    To make machines that’re smarter and smarter<br>
    That can kill more people cheaper and faster<br>
    That’ll lead us right to nuclear disaster<br>
    Everybody thinks that it’s power he’s after<br>
    Cause everybody wants to forget<br>
    That you can’t be any richer than to know you’re alive<br>
    And you can’t be any poorer than dead</p>

    <p>When your employer works you harder than you’re paid to<br> 
    And you can’t ask for a raise cause you’re afraid to<br>
    And your money can’t be spent on anything except the rent<br>

    Don’t you flinch or hesitate<br>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Early one morning, the whole world fast asleep<br>
    A hobo was layin out dead in the street<br>
    Like a prayer left unanswered, a call left undailed<br>
    He was nobody’s darling, but he was somebody’s child</p>

    <p>Had a thirst keen on whisky, but he always was blunt<br>
    Never had any money, always said so up front<br>
    What’ll it be, dad—the barkeep’d ask with a smile<br>
    “I ain’t nobody’s father—I’m just somebody’s child,”</p>

    <p>He’d sleep on park-benches when he was down on his luck<br>
    And he’d ask for spare quarters when he was hard up<br>
    But he never liked hand-outs and he always desired<br>
    To be treated decent, like somebody’s child</p>
 
    <p>With his hands on a bottle, as if in a pose<br>
    Near a mountain of garbage, he’d sat down and froze<br>
    For months he just sat there, preserved, undefiled<br>
    But even an old man’s still somebody’s child</p>
 
    <p>The leaves changed their colors and the weather turned raw<br>
    And the rain fell in sheets by gravity’s law<br>
    while the snowflakes fell softly, so delicately piled<br>
    they covered the body of somebody’s child</p>
 
    <p>The people walked by him, and some of them stared<br>
    Some threw out their pennies, but nobody cared<br>
    But where is there refuge for the city’s exiled?<br>
    Show me where is the person that ain’t somebody’s child?</p>
 
    <p>Not a family to speak of, he didn’t have no home<br>
    Midst the crowds of the city, he was all alone<br>
    The name that the coroner wrote down and filed<br>
    In the absence of any was “somebody’s child,”</p>
 
    <p>Some folks’re lucky—they’re born into it all<br>
    Some come out fighting with their backs gainst the wall<br>
    Some grow more civil, other’s just get wild<br>
    But everyone starts out bein somebody’s child.</p>

    <p>Everybody knows that slavery ended with the civil war<br> 
    Equality and freedom were well worth dyin for<br>
    And people claim that race is not an issue anymore<br>
    But of whites to blacks in prison the ratio’s now one to four<br>
    but if you ain’t pale and privileged, it’s hard to ignore<br>
    And everybody knows the story of how we won our civil rights<br>
    The blacks received the ballot, the same as the whites<br>
    We ended segregation and all appeared to be alright<br>
    But the dawn of a new era just brought on another night</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case, my friend<br>
    Its black and its white, time and again<br>
    As crime rates continue to slow and descend<br>
    <s>“but we’re vanquishing crime,” the politicians contend</s><br>
    Meanwhile prison population just grows<br>
    <s>And it ain’t cause the times haven’t changed</s><br>
    <s>The more they have, the more they’ve just stayed the same</s><br>
    <s>But you never call things by their names—under the new jim crow</s><br>
    But crime ain’t the thing being fought<br>
    Despite what you’ve been told and taught<br>
    You can’t prove innocence when you’re caught—under the new jim crow</p>
 
    <p>That the US polices all the world I’ve heard it’s leaders claim<br>
    Incarcerationally speaking the US puts the world to shame<br>
    Using words of law and order, from seeming racist they’ve abstained<br>
    But slavery ain’t abolished, it’s just wearing a new name<br>
    It’d be hard to gage or guess how far the justice system’s failed<br>
    When millions of people in this free country have been jailed<br>
    Beneath the pretense of a war on crime, the cracking down’s entailed<br>
    A round-up of the ones without the means to pay the bail</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case my friends,<br>
    It’s black and it’s white, time and again<br>
    The pattern by nows a predictable trend<br>
    Whose numbers just go to show<br>
    that justice is still just a dream<br>
    Except for the whites with the means<br>
    That’s all that equality means—under the new jim crow<br>
    <s>That you can’t blame the blind hand of fate</s><br>
    <s>When the criminal is yours to create</s><br>
    <s>And is judged less by his deeds than his traits—Under the new jim crow</s></p>
 
    <p>When it’s expected that young poor black males will likelier serve time<br>
    Than receive their due diplomas in their graduation lines<br>
    And the judges in the courtrooms all claim they’re colorblind<br>
    While from the schoolyard to the jailyard there’s no black child left behind<br>
    And once you’ve been to prison, the lifelong label you will wear<br>
    But you know it will prevent you from ever getting anywhere<br>
    They’ll say it’s nothing personal as they tell you to prepare<br>
    To become someone about whom nobody has to care</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case my friends<br>
    Its black and its white, time and again<br>
    The rule of the law to the accused never bends<br>
    It was broken, a long time ago—<br>
    The rights that your laws are supposed to defend<br>
    Were suspended a long time ago<br>
    But the history’s too painful to trace<br>
    And the music’s just too sad to face<br>
    And no one wants to talk about race—under the new jim crow</p> 

    <p>And some cannot believe we could be further from the track<br>
    When even the president of the united states is black<br>
    You’d think it would mean something but it’s only been an act<br>
    In the name of social progress we’ve all turned our watches back<br>
    When the police shoot the people they ought to protect<br>
    And any motion for indictment the grand jury must reject<br>
    On account of police bullets in black bodies ain’t suspect<br>
    And black children have to wear “Don’t Shoot Me” signs around their necks</p>

    <p>Just look at the facts of the case, my friends<br>
    It’s black and its white, time and again<br>
    And whether you’re free all seems to depend<br>
    Upon which way the wind wants to blow<br>
    With one percent of your people enslaved<br>
    In this land of the free and the brave<br>
    Tell me, America, O say<br>
    Does that star spangled banner yet wave—under the new jim crow?</p>

    <h2>The Fine Print</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 9</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Well I woke up with a bit of a condition<br> 
    So I went in to consult with my physician<br>
    He told me I would need an operation<br>
    And that it just couldn’t wait</p>

    <p>He said he’d need my authorized permission<br>
    In order to proceed with an excision<br>
    Gave me papers which I signed with the conviction<br>
    That soon it would be too late</p>

    <p>The next week I was starting to feel better<br>
    That is until I got a letter<br>
    It was from hospital bill-collector<br>
    He said I owed him twenty-thousand dollars</p>

    <p>I called and said, “tell me how can this be?<br>
    I’m being overcharged exorbitantly—<br>
    Isn’t my insurance going to front me?<br>
    I tell you I just can’t pay!”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
    They said, “You should’ve gone ahead and read the fine print<br>
    You might’ve understood a little different<br>
    It might’ve seemed like something that it isn’t<br>
    Should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, might’ve—but you didn’t”</p>

    <p>So I went down to the bank to take a loan out<br>
    They said okay just take and fill this form out<br>
    I asked them to tell me what it all was about<br>
    They said it’s just S.O.P.</p>

    <p>They asked me what I needed all that cash for<br>
    I told them that I had to pay my doctor<br>
    they told me that my income was a factor<br>
    and did I have a full-time job</p>

    <p>I told them at the moment I did not yet<br>
    my doctor said I’d have to wait a while yet<br>
    I couldn’t work until my bones were all set<br>
    The banker-lady said: No Dice.</p>
 
    <p>they said I’d need a record of some credit<br>
    Without which I might as well forget it<br>
    they said its in the contract and I read it<br>
    and they pointed at my signature</p>
 
    <p>I said “a man is not all he endorses”<br>
    They said, wait just a minute, hold your horses<br>
    They said the catch about this all, of course, is<br>
    That your interest starts today</p>
 
    <p>chorus</p>
 
    <p>So then I went out seeking some employment<br>
    Which you will imagine brought me no enjoyment<br>
    I applied without discretion or discernment<br>
    For any and everything</p>
 
    <p>I got a job working at a factry<br>
    Worked there two full weeks and then they sacked me<br>
    Told me they’d do better if they lacked me<br>
    I said what about my two-weeks pay?</p>
 
    <p>They pulled me out a crumpled piece of paper<br>
    they said I signed it: didn’t I remember?<br>
    they read me off my driver’s license number<br>
    Said I’d be getting none from them</p>
 
    <p>They said that in my contract there’s a section<br>
    Where they reserved the right to termination<br>
    Any day or time or place for any reason<br>
    And to withhold pay</p>
 
    <p>chorus</p>
 
    <p>well, I decided this was an injustice<br>
    a situation legal action must fix<br>
    so I got myself a lawyer on the off-chance<br>
    that things could be resolved</p>
 
    <p>I wrote up a complaint and a proposal<br>
    An amount for which I’d be willing to settle<br>
    They laughed and said that it would go to trial<br>
    And that I was bound to lose</p>
 
    <p>My lawyer showed a fierce determination<br>
    To stand up against the corporation<br>
    And would not be swayed by their intimidation<br>
    No matter how they tried</p>
 
    <p>Well after the judge and jury heard it<br>
    They came up with the following verdict<br>
    they said they didn’t quite know how to word it<br>
    except to say that I had lost</p>
 
    <p>My lawyer declared it was an outrage<br>
    But even so it wouldn’t make the front page<br>
    He said “another worker’s robbed of his wage—<br>
    It happens every single day.”</p>
 
    <p>Then he sincerely gave me condolences<br>
    And handed me a bill of his expenses<br>
    I asked him if he’d gone and lost his senses<br>
    What did he expect me to do?</p>
 
    <p>I thought that if we lost I owed him zero<br>
    He said that’s just in cases of pro bono<br>
    He said that “in the contract…” I said “oh no—<br>
    Here we go again,”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t aim to keep you people guessin<br>
    About the moral of this story, or the lesson<br>
    The only thing I aim to be suggestin<br>
    Is to keep your eyes open wide</p>

    <p>The next time that you go to see a lawyer<br>
    Or a banker or a doctor or employer<br>
    Or anyone who claims that they’ve got your<br>
    Best interest at heart</p>
 
    <p>Make sure you bring along your readin glasses<br>
    Make sure you dot the I’s and note the dashes<br>
    Of everything that your signature passes<br>
    And make a copy for your files</p>

    <h2>Song for the Unsung</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>This is the song for the unsung heroes<br> 
    For the losers and zeroes no history records<br>
    For the plain and blameless quiet nameless<br>
    Many who never stray too far from the shore<br> 
    Who work their hardest for no one’s notice<br>
    Who earn their money but have to steal their rest<br>
    Who lose their chances at the cheap salvation<br>
    As they fall far short of ever being second best</p>

    <p>You daily grinders and watch-spring winders<br>
    Hopeless reminders of what all you might have been<br>
    I salute you in all your strivings<br>
    Remember there are more of you than them</p>
 
    <p>This is the song for the ordinary sister<br>
    Of the beauty contest winner with the recessive traits<br>
    Whom no one stares at or asks to dinner<br>
    Or invites out dancing or wants to date<br>
    Who grows to old age and never marries<br>
    Who has no children to call her very own<br>
    But who gives her love out to all who’ll take it<br>
    And is, wherever she is, right at home</p>

    <p>This is the song for the unknown soldier<br>
    Who grew no bolder the nearer war he got<br>
    Who aimed his rifle for his own survival<br>
    At his would-be enemy but never took the shot<br>
    Who died in battle, came home like chattel,<br>
    Was laid to rest in an unmarked pauper’s grave<br>
    Was unremembered save as young and foolish<br>
    And by a few who knew him as less than brave</p>

    <p>You adventure seekers, timid time-keepers<br>
    Who watch the bleachers from the middle of the fray<br>
    As you go headlong into unknown country<br>
    May God bless and keep you safe upon your way</p>
 
    <p>This is the song for the obscure explorer<br>
    Who winds up poorer than when he started out<br>
    Who never arrives at his destination<br>
    Whose explanation the world must do without<br>
    Who will lose his compass, his only atlas<br>
    Whose tears of madness will ingredient the sea<br>
    As the waves that pound him will lift and drown him<br>
    With his question sounding: will anyone remember me?</p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 11</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>You billionaires in your big easy chairs<br>
    counting your coins and your dough<br>
    What do you need with all that money?<br>
    You can’t take it with you, you know</p>
 
    <p>You’ve hedged all your bets, you’ve become a success,<br>
    your kingdom spreads out far and wide<br>
    but when will your stuff ever bring you enough?<br>
    When will you be satisfied?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
    When pigs learn to fly, when hell freezes o’er<br>
    When the rocks in the mountains can sing<br>
    But just cause they don’t, it don’t mean that they won’t<br>
    There’s a first time for everything</p>
 
    <p>You big-business bosses who cut all your losses<br>
    Who pay less than the minimum wage<br>
    Whose labor’s on lease somewheres overseas<br>
    Cause it’s cheaper and all of the rage</p>

    <p>What will you say to folks comin your way<br>
    When outside your door they are packed<br>
    Screamin for work and callin you jerk<br>
    Sayin, “When can we have our jobs back?”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now the healthcare debate in the united states<br>
    Is as fierce as it is anywhere<br>
    When the state of your health depends on your wealth<br>
    That don’t exactly seem fair</p>
 
    <p>I need to be cured, but I ain’t insured<br>
    It’s the most I can do just to beg<br>
    When will I receive the care that I need<br>
    Without payin an arm and a leg?</p>
 
    <p>chorus</p>
 
    <p>You judges who sit, who condemn and acquit<br>
    Who hear bout the worst that men do<br>
    Aloft in your towers with your gowns and your powers<br>
    Who gets to pass judgment on you?</p>
 
    <p>You’ll seal a man’s fate to be killed by the state<br>
    You’ll kill thinking your doing what’s best<br>
    But when will a man’s life be too high a price<br>
    To weigh in the scales against death?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now the world is at war over oil and ore<br>
    Over power and territory<br>
    Over whose God is in charge and whose is not<br>
    On that point no one can agree</p>
 
    <p>Meanwhile bombs descend on women and children<br>
    When O when will it cease?<br>
    When will the fight desist for the night<br>
    When will the world live in peace?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now perhaps I’m naieve, as green as the leaves<br>
    That sprout on the trees in the spring<br>
    Maybe I’m touched to be thinking so much<br>
    We all know what wishin can bring</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps I’m a dope to hope without hope<br>
    But there’s one thing that I’ve always known<br>
    If you want things to improve, well you gotta move<br>
    Cause they ain’t gonna change on their own</p>
 
    <p>So get yourself wise and get organized<br>
    Lift up your voices and sing<br>
    Cause if you don’t, they probably wont<br>
    There’s a last time for everything</p>

    <h2>Where My Yard Used to Be (There's an Oil Field There)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Aint It a Pity?, 2016</i> Track 12</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#aintItaPity_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>This morning I woke to the sound of a blast<br>
    “Who’s there? Who’s there? Who is it?” I asked<br>
    A man was outside wearing some kind of mask<br>
    Said he was with Halliburton Oil and Gas</p>
 
    <p>He gave me a paper which he asked me to sign<br>
    What is it? I asked him, he said, “Nevermind,”<br>
    Said if I just put my name down on yon dotted line<br>
    Ten thousand dollars could be instantly mine</p>
 
    <p>I was still a bit groggy but it sounded alright to me<br>
    I signed his paper and I went back to sleep<br>
    And when I awoke I wanted to shriek<br>
    They drilled a hole on my property 10,000 feet deep</p>
 
    <p>Now where my yard used to be there’s an oil field there<br>
    They tell me I signed it away fair and square<br>
    But now I can’t drink my water and I can’t breathe my air<br>
    Please Mr. Gas-man, is it just that you don’t know what you’re doing—or that you don’t care?</p>
 
    <p>Well I made several inquiries and asked for a report<br>
    About this hydraulic fracturing, or fracking for short<br>
    And when I tried to protest, to make them cease and abort<br>
    They laughed and just told me they’d see me in court</p>
 
    <p>Shortly thereafter I realized my mistake<br>
    When they turned my pond into a gasoline lake<br>
    I wish someone had told me bout the risk I would take<br>
    That the losses would outweigh the money I’d make</p>
 
    <p>Now oil companies claim that its cheap, and what’s more<br>
    we don’t have to rely on foreign oil anymore<br>
    but as time passes by you can’t fail to ignore<br>
    that gas is two bucks a gallon, but now fresh-water costs four</p>
 
    <p>and where my fields used to be, there’s an oil-field there<br>
    and where my woods used to be, there’s an oil-field there<br>
    and you can’t drink the water and you can’t breathe the air<br>
    Please Mr. Gas-man, is it just that you don’t know what you’re doing—or that you don’t care?</p>
 
    <p>and if you’re inclined to think it ain’t as bad as it sounds<br>
    you ought to check on the chemicals they’re putting into your ground<br>
    ethyl-methyls, and sulfates, in lethal amounts<br>
    plus 500 others I can’t even pronounce</p>
 
    <p>Now the trees that once grew here have all been cut down<br>
    The air, once so clean, now looks dirty and brown<br>
    the birds all flew off, the fishes all drowned<br>
    next thing you know, it’ll be me skipping town</p>
 
    <p>and tell me, what will you do when your well’s overdrawn?<br>
    When you’ve lost what you’ve built your tomorrows upon?<br>
    When you finally realize all along you’ve been wrong?<br>
    Tell me where will you go when our planet is gone?</p>
 
    <p>When, where the earth used to be, there’s an oil-field there?<br>
    When you finally realize that you haven’t a spare?<br>
    I’ll ask you in hope, and I’ll plea in despair:<br>
    Please Mr. Gas-man, is it just that you don’t know what you’re doing—or that you don’t care?</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t know about you, what your tomorrows are worth<br>
    If you think it’ll get better before it gets worse<br>
    But when you damage the planet, everyone hurts<br>
    And you’re killing the future by destroying the earth</p>

    <p>Now the gas and oil companies are rolling in wealth<br>
    But they need your permission to keep spreading their filth<br>
    So if they ask, in the interest of keeping your health,<br>
    Say: you can’t frack my land, you can go frack yourself!</p>

    If I told you I loved you and sang about it—would you love me then?<br>
    If I had influence, title, rank, or position<br>
    If I changed my name, my race, my religion<br>
    If I told you I was eager to hear your decision—would you love me then?<br>
     If I promised to leave you alone forever—would you love me then?<br>
    If I told you we didn’t have to be together—would you love me then?<br>
    If I took your advice, your offered suggestion<br>
    If I swore I wouldn’t make any public confession<br>
    If I promised not to ask you anymore questions—mm, would you love me then?    </p>

    <p>If the sun tomorrow should rise and find me gone from your side<br>
    If my life should transpire so quick as to fit to within the blink of an eye<br>
    If all of the dust of my days should be scattered in ten different ways<br>
    And the ocean complains that nothing remains to answer the one who asks why<br>

    If all of my cries should fall short of the home t’where they fly<br>
    If they shatter and break on the walls of the gate that proves too strong and too high<br>
    If word of me never returns, and my whereabouts never get learned<br>

    <h2>Tell Me Something I Don't Already Know</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>At Least There Will Be Love, 2016</i> Track 3</h4>

    <p>You woke me with a question from your distant past you said it was not urgent but it would require some attention soon<br>
I followed up by askin what you meant by that but this was later some time long after you had already left the room<br>
The times we’ve tried have not been few, although communication has perhaps at times been rare<br>
And tho I’ve said, it’s up to you, it’s clear to me that you’d prefer that it remain unshared<br>
            And that’s alright, if that’s your style<br>
            You’ve got that right, you’re not on trial<br>
            I’d appreciate it if the next time tho<br>
            You’d tell me something that I don’t already know<br>
I recall that you returned to me, eventually, with an apology you said you couldn’t write but had to say to me<br>
That spoke of things that never were, that tried to be, that might have been perhaps if only it hadn’t been for me<br>
You called me names, suggested lies, pretended I had only been your enemy<br>
You said, “Love is born, it lives and dies, and people change and are a challenge to their destiny—”<br>
            And you’re not wrong, that’s not quite it<br>
            Cause you don’t belong with me I’ll admit<br>
            But the next time that you come to say you have to go<br>
            Tell me something that I don’t already know<br>
 We’ve covered all this ground before, there’s nothing new to speak of with regards to where it leaves us, where we must remain<br>
I know you’ll go on hoping I’m a wound to you while I’ll go back to dreaming at the drawingboard, my windowpane<br>
And all that’s left of all that was in me will linger faintly as a residue<br>
And looking down, from up above, perhaps at last you’ll catch the contrast in our points of view<br>
             But if you don’t because you choose<br>
            And say you won’t because you’d lose<br>
            The chance to tell the mighty that they’ve fallen low<br>
            Well tell me something that I don’t already know</p>

    <p>Sky’s gone cloudy and the sun’s been dim<br>
    It seems the stars these days are always late<br>
    And it won’t be long now fore the rain sets in<br>
    But all there is to do is wait<br>
     Please take my picture when you go from here<br>
    As it will help me not to feel so far from you<br>
    And I’ll try less often to wish you near<br>
    When, or rather, if, I do<br>
                And if I should survive, as I think I probly will<br>
                As I only ever have before<br>
                It will not be because of me<br>
                It will be because you know I’m yours<br>
    I watched your shadow as you weaved the loom<br>
    Your clothing lay draped over the chairs<br>
    A Casanova with a pink balloon<br>
    Waiting like a child on the stairs<br>
    Please take me with you when you go from here<br>
    As it will help me not to feel so far from you<br>
    And I’ll try less often to feel the fear<br>
    If, or rather, when, I do<br>
                And if I should survive as I think I will,<br>
                As I only ever have before<br>
                It will not be because of me<br>
                It will be because you know I’m yours    </p>

    <p>Shes the sun at dawn, shes a dream you drawn<br>
    She’s a train you’ll chase forever that don’t never let you on<br>
    She’s beautiful, she’s both hands full<br>
    She’s cautious as a fledgling calf, and fragile as a fawn<br>
     She knows her bounds and your hopes she’ll drown<br>
    Her eyes are like the well you cast your lonesome wishes down<br>
    She’s a misplayed chord, she’s a two-edged sword<br>
    She’s a bird that’s fallen that never even left the ground<br>
                 She cant be held, contained nor quelled<br>
                And she don’t reside even where she says she’s dwelled<br>
                She ain’t coming soon, but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love<br>
     She’s a ragin tide, downright dignified<br>
    A wildfire wadin through a callow countryside<br>
    She’s my favorite song, my whole life long<br>
    She’s the failure I was faced with every single time I tried<br>
     She’s a waving flag, she’s a boundin stag<br>
    Free as a feather floating down a canyon crag<br>
    She’s a broken soul, she’s a lost-sheep’s wool<br>
    She’s a priceless linen mixed-in with a beggar’s bandage rag<br>
                 She can’t be reached through spoken speech <br>
                And she breathes in vapors near the boundary’s breach<br>
                She ain’t comin soon but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love<br>
     She’s a quiet smirk, she’s full of quirk<br>
    She’s like ivy growin upwards through the garden lattic-work<br>
    Her voice is sure, and her heart is pure<br>
    She’s a soothing salve for every wound you’ve got that’s hurt<br>
    She’s full of tricks, she’s too fair to fix<br>
    She’s a churchmouse crawling cross the crucifix<br>
    She’s a wisp of smoke, she’s a wooden spoke<br>
    She’s a spur upon a bootheel that’s never learned to kick<br>
                 She can’t be caught, revealed nor wrought<br>
                She’s a matter of fact, upon a second thought<br>
                She ain’t coming soon, but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love<br>
     She’s a friendly face, she’s a saving grace<br>
    She’s a trap-door hinged upon a hiding place<br>
    She’s a standing cliff, she’s a hieroglyph<br>
    She’s a strong defense that doesn’t have no case<br>
     She’s a windin brook, she’s a chance that’s took<br>
    She’s the same old story in a brand new book<br>
    She’s an ocean wave, she’s a shallow grave<br>
    She’s the knight that left the bishop to defend the rook<br>
                 She can’t be known, can’t be left alone<br>
                She is my journey, my friend, my home<br>
                She ain’t coming soon, but I wish she was<br>
                For she’s the only girl whom with all my heart I love    </p>

    <p>I must be cursed; the fates must be against me<br>
    She’s taken no interest; she can’t even sense me<br>
    I’m a face in a crowd that’s well neath her status,<br>
    That’s an audience to her, that she’ll never notice<br>
                She don’t even know me, but that ain’t the problem<br>
                The one thing we share’s having nothing in common<br>
                A stranger with whom I wish I were familiar<br>
                If only so that I could finally tell her</p>
                            <p>That I’m helplessly, hopelessly, endlessly,  openly,<br>
                            Neverthelessly in love with you<br>
                            Brokenly, quietly, quite unrequitedly<br>
                            Somehow inspite of me, in love with you</p>
    <p>I’m boundless and depthless and restless and breathless<br>
                And it’d be a short list to name what I wouldn’t do<br>
                To show you how sweetly, how madly, completely,<br>
                How badly, how deeply, I’m in love with you<br>
    Whenever she’s near, I can feel my pulse racing<br>
    Every minute she’s gone feels like time I’m just wasting<br>
    To somebody’s dreams she must be the native<br>
    But she’s just in my world—I’m not that creative<br>
                If I could imagine her daily and nightly<br>
                And all on my own, however unlikely<br>
                I’d probably need never roam any further<br>
                There’d be no cause to alarm or alert her</p>
                            <p>That I’m visibly, viably, undeniably<br>
                            Certifiably in love with you<br>
                            Joylessly, lucklessly, sorely, reluctantly,<br>
                            It’s not even up to me, in  love with you</p>
    <p>I’m weary and woeful, I’m inconsolable<br>
                And from the depths of my own soul I wish it weren’t true<br>
                But I’m clinically, cynically, consciously, critically<br>
                Admittedly—in love with you    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#atLeastThereWillBeLove_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I looked all round the world for a love of my own<br>
    Now I’ve been everywhere and I’m still all alone<br>
    Just when I started thinking true love can’t be found<br>
    Who but I should start falling when who but you turns around</p>
                <p>When I said that it takes time for new love to bloom<br>
                It might be that I might’ve spoke a little too soon<br>
                You know what they say, it ain’t good to presume<br>
                It might be that I might’ve spoke a little too soon</p>
    <p>Well the first thing you told me is that youd be all mine<br>
    Next thing I know I’m half out of my mind<br>
    Feel like running and hiding, feel like walking right out<br>
    You say you just want to know what I’ve been thinking about</p>
                <p>When I said as long as I had you I would never be doomed<br>
                Well it might be that I might have spoke a little too soon</p>
                <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>I know how to want you just as well as the next<br>
    Its remaining happy once you’re mine I don’t get<br>
    I know that you told me I was all out of tries<br>
    But that you weren’t kidding I guess I didn’t quite realize</p>
                <p>When I said that nobody’d ever make me change my own tune<br>
                Well it might be that I might’ve spoke a little too soon</p>
                <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>When I told you I loved you unconditionally<br>
    I was under the impression you felt the same way about me<br>
    When I asked if you wanted to come be my wife<br>
    I thought it meant that I would be the only man in your life</p>
                <p>But you got one in the stairwell and one up in your room<br>
                Well it might be that I might have spoke a little too soon</p>
                 <p>Chorus</p>

    <p>Bout the hour the sun goes down, I get to thinking of leaving town<br>
    The trains and traffic they make their sounds, a blood within me begins to pound<br>
    She calls to tell me she’s on her way, she knows I get round that time of day<br>
    Feeling like I’d be stuck to stay, better off just a goin way</p>
                <p>I feel my feet start to leave the ground<br>
                I step away and I’m fallin down<br>
                I feel your arms they’re around me now<br>
                But tell me, babe, do you have me, now?<br>
                 I’m hardly home and I’m highway bound<br>
                I’m known to run at the smallest sound<br>
                I’m known to hide where I won’t be found<br>
                So tell me, babe, do you have me, now?</p>
    <p>Lifted out of the mangled mess, I’m back out on the top, I guess<br>
    Just wrestling the restlessness, I won’t win but I’ll do my best<br>
    She’s sturdy as frozen stone, does alright when she’s on her own<br>
    The kindest of the kind of known, the closest I’ve ever been to home</p>
                <p>I think I’d live if she left me now<br>
                And if I left would I be allowed<br>
                I could love if you’d show me how<br>
                But tell me, babe, do you have me now?<br>
                 I feel your kisses against my brow<br>
                I hear you say that we should and shall<br>
                I hear you say you don’t need no vow<br>
                But tell me babe do you have me now?</p>
    <p>She keeps me close and she holds me tight, walks me through each and every night<br>
    She ain’t afraid to put up a fight, makes it seem like it’ll be alright<br>
    But in the morning she leaves again, and tho she says she’ll come back again<br>
    And tho I tell her I’ll see her then, I always hope I’ll still be here then</p>
                <p>I spread my wings and she holds me down<br>
                I try to swim and she helps me drown<br>
                I start to cry and she calls me clown<br>
                But tell me babe do you have me now?<br>
                 Cause I can fly without leavin ground<br>
                And I can dive without goin down<br>
                And I can kid without foolin round<br>
                So tell me babe do you have me now?</p>
    <p>About a mile down the railroad track, I get to thinking of thinkin back<br>
    I wonder if she would take me back, if she knew I was comin back<br>
    Left a note in her dresser drawer, sayin how I just wasn’t sure<br>
    Sayin how I would lock the door, but not to wait up for me no more</p>
                <p>Tell me babe, would you have me now?<br>
                Now that you know that I’m broken down?<br>
                Now that you know I don’t wear no crown?<br>
                Now that you know I won’t stick around?<br>
                 Tell me babe do you have me now?<br>
                Now that I’m somewhere behind you now?<br>
                Now that at least I can’t hurt you now?<br>
                Now that I can’t desert you now?</p>

    <p>She may not even remember me now, it was so long ago<br>
    I recall when she left it was winter again, her footprints had trailed in the snow<br>
    And when spring came around they had melted away and by then I had learned to forget<br>
    That it wasn’t because she didn’t love me enough that she had been so upset<br>
                And I know it don’t do nobody no good to say it now after all this time<br>
                But it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but mine</p>

    <p>There’ve been so many others since her, but she was the first<br>
    And maybe it’s just cause I loved her the most, that losing her hurt the worst<br>
    And maybe I am still just holding on cause I’m lonesome with everyone else<br>
    And maybe I only want her back cause I’m so tired of myself <br>
                But whatever it is that’s causing all this, there’s one thing to which I’m resigned<br>
                It’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but mine</p>

    <p>This morning I found an old letter of hers in my desk’s bottom drawer<br>
    It contained a long list of things that she missed about me and loved me for<br>
    At the end of the note she apparently wrote I will always love only you<br>
    And after all of these years what makes me afeared is thinking that it might still be true<br>
                I wish I could say I was sorry now, how could I have been so blind<br>
                But it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but mine</p>

    <p>Now as I sit here in familiar solitude, unvisited even by noise<br>
    I like to pretend that it had to be so, that neither one of us had any choice<br>
    Its easy to feel like she did it to me, like nothing I said was believed<br>
    But sometimes the truth creeps in through the roof and says you aint lyin, you’re just self-deceived<br>
                Cause she was the one who wanted to stay, and I told her to go, now she’s gone<br>
                And its nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault, it’s nobody’s fault—but my own    </p>

    <p>For all of the lies that I told<br>
    For getting away with the fast ones I pulled<br>
    Persisting, even when it got old<br>
    For leaving you standing alone in the cold<br>

                And for wrecklessly leading you on<br>

                            But for whatever it’s worth, if it has any impact, 
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For leaving it all up to fate<br>
    For devising the trap and laying the bait<br>
    For offering too little too late<br>
    For destroying the plans that you tried to create<br>
                for being the one who was never around<br>
                and accusing you of disappearing<br>
                for ruthlessly kicking you when you were down<br>
                and afterwards trying to be so endearing</p>
                            <p>The time of the day I don’t even deserve
                            But I don’t need it, I’m in no hurry<br>
                            I know that you think that I’ve sure got some nerve
                            But I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>         
    <p>for wanting you to be like you were<br>
    for acting so childish and so immature<br>
    for expecting you to be pure<br>
    and treating you like you were part of the tour<br>
                for letting you fall when you needed a hand<br>
                up from the floor you were sweeping<br>
                for pretending that I could not understand<br>
                the language in which you were speaking </p>
                            <p>I know that my efforts have not been enough
                            A gentleman I have been, hardly<br>
                            But before you go writing me entirely off
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For totally wasting your time<br>
    For being unwell, saying that I was fine<br>
    For feeding you all the old lines<br>
    For failing to make you a priority of imine<br>
                For doing the absolute least I could do<br>
                And not even without complaining<br>
                And for taking even your umbrella from you<br>
                The minute that it started raining</p>
                            <p>If you don’t ever want to see me again 
                            And if you never ans—wer me<br>
                            I’ll understand, but I might as well then
                            Tell you now fore I go—that I’m sorry</p>      
    <p>For making you miss the last train<br>
    For keeping the torch lit for an old flame<br>
    For driving you slowly insane<br>
    For making you guess instead of saying it plain<br>
                For treating this all like no more than a fling<br>
                As you asked: O why must you tease me?<br>
                And then when it came time to do the right thing<br>
                For doing instead what felt easy</p>
                            <p>I know in the past, when I’ve said this before
                            Your silences have frequently scarred me<br> 
                            I know you can’t put up with me anymore
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For utterly failing to learn<br>
    For leaving long fore the meeting adjourned <br>
    For making you wait for your turn<br>
    To be treated decent, like it was something you’d earn<br>
                For salting the wound, and fueling the flame<br>
                Adding insult to your injury<br>
                for whimpering whenever saying your name <br>
                And making sure that you heard me</p>
                            <p>Your more patient with me than anyone else 
                            I’d’ve featherd and tarred me<br>
                            But this time I ain’t gonna ask for you help
                            I just want you to know—that I’m sorry</p>
    <p>For throwing you under the bus<br>
    For staining your pride and abusing your trust<br>
    For making you feel that you must<br>
    For ditching you in a cloud of my dust<br>
                For gorging myself, meanwhile letting you starve<br>
                like some well-wishing judas<br>
                For handing you over to the people in charge<br>
                While you kindly mistook me for Brutus </p>
                            <p>And nevermind silver, nevermind gold
                            I’d’ve done it for thirty denari<br>
                            And if it’s the last thing I ever tell to the world
                            I just want you to know—I’m sorry</p>

    <p>You been a poor wife to your husband, you been a bad mother to your child<br>
    You ain’t been much to speak of to your folks in some long while<br>
    You been something of a let-down to your whole family<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>You been bad news to your landlord ever since you signed that lease<br>
    The only visitors you get in here are either junkies or police<br>
    You been wanted for a while now, everyone’s your enemy<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>You been a disgrace to your people, you’ve exhibited no pride<br>
    When the spies came you went to them and you invited them inside<br>
    You’d be called a traitor back in your home country<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>Everybody says you’re crazy, when you look they all turn around<br>
    Nobody seems to like you much you’re just too hard to be around<br>
    That’s the same way that people talk when they’re talkin about me<br>
    Aw, but you know you been a good friend to me</p>

    <p>Should your laughter turn to tears, and should your smile straighten out<br>
    Should the minutes turn to years, and your assurances to doubt<br>
    And should there be only half as much love here as you say<br>
    If you never leave the path<br>
    You tell a joke and no one laughs<br>
    If you never learn to do the math, <br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And should the ease become a strain, and should the work become a toil<br>
    And should our happiness be plain, and inseperable from soil<br>
    And should the tune become so flat which we always used to play<br>
    That the music won’t come back<br>
    We only hear it as a lack<br>
    Both because of and despite that<br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And should your looks begin to go, and should your wits begin to dim<br>
    And should your age begin to show, through the wrinkles on your skin<br>
    And should you become so old that your hair has all turned gray<br>
    When your stories have been told<br>
    And your teeth have all been pulled<br>
    And when you’re far too frail to hold<br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And when you are not here, and when I am by myself,<br>
    And when the future isn’t clear, and when you seem like someone else<br>
    I will not find you strange, nor will it be to my dismay<br>
    For in spite of how you change, <br>
    you come in and out of range<br>
    It can’t be helped, you won’t be blamed<br>
                I will still love you anyway</p>

    <p>And if we never aren’t poor, and if I discover that you’re flawed<br>
    And if we always aren’t sure, and leave it mostly up to God<br>
    At least there will be love, when all else has passed away<br>
    And when pushing comes to shove<br>
    When I’m no longer who I was<br>
    And when nobody else does<br>
                I will still love you anyway    </p>

    <p>Rooster’s in the henhouse with his feathers all mussed<br>
    the hay-barn is burning and the milk’s gone sour<br>
    It’s harvesting time but the whole crop’s a bust<br>
    And that’s the third thunderstrike I’ve heard in the past half-hour<br>
                Been up for three days in a drippin cold-sweat<br>
                I called for a doctor and they sent me a vet<br>
                I’m losing my livelihood along with a bet<br>
                and I ain’t even had my coffee yet</p>

    <p>the ship’s hit an ice-berg and the radio’s down<br>
    the captain’s in the crow’s nest trying to get drunk<br>
    Nero’s somewhere fiddling, and we’re all gonna drown<br>
    somebody send an S.O.S.—we’re sunk!<br>
                Throw out your preservers, cast wide your net<br>
                We gonna need all the mother-lovin luck that we can get<br>
                We’re in the middle of nowhere, and I’m all wet—<br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet</p>

    <p>Private detective’s in his best disguise<br>
    He’s already taken a few incriminating photographs<br>
    He’s got the evidence to prove whatever the defendant denies<br>
    He caught the guy with his secretary, takin a bath<br>
                A lady pulls up in her ex-husband’s corvette<br>
                As the private I.’s lighting his last cigarette<br>
                She asks if it’s done—he says, “We’re all set—<br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet”</p>

    <p>Productivity’s down, and the factory’s pinched<br>
    Management doesn’t know what to do<br>
    The union fellas won’t surrender an inch<br>
    And the strike ain’t nowhere near being through<br>
                The thing to remember is that no-one forgets<br>
                If it’s a do-or-die matter, I say “Let’s!”<br>
                Every time I answer the phone, it’s a brand new threat         <br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet</p>

    <p>Alarm clock went off first thing in the morning<br>
    Didn’t even get the paper before I heard the news<br>
    Neighbors were outside in their bathrobes quarreling<br>
    Election’s over and half the nation’s singing the blues<br>
                Sweep the confetti from your TV sets<br>
                Better call up your friends and forgive them their debts<br>
                The sun’s barely up, I’m full of regrets— <br>
                And I ain’t even had my coffee yet       </p>

    <p>The way that an amputee misses his limb<br>
    After the doctor has sawn it from him<br>
    Leaving him only the scar of his skin<br>
    With which he must try to adapt<br>
     Or the way that an arrow that’s aimed at the heart<br>
    Of some would-be lover alone in the dark<br>
    Can near and so narrowly still miss the mark<br>
    Hitting some bystander’s back <br>
                Or the way that a jury can believe what it wants having just received all of the facts<br>
                I miss you—I miss you—I miss you—like that</p>

    <p>The way that a baby cries for the breast <br>
    Of the woman who maybe has sins to confess<br>
    Whose feeling her worst when she’s doing her best<br>
    For whom smiling’s part of the act<br>
     Or the way that a shipwreck wants to be saved <br>
    From his raft on the water where he’s drifted for days<br>
    Where he can still get a signal on his radio wave<br>
    But cannot explain where he’s at<br>
                 Or the way that a mackerel still goes for the hook, even knowing that it’s just a trap<br>
                I want you—I want you—I want you—like that</p>

    <p>The way that a parachute needs to unfold <br>
    As soon as the cord is reached for and pulled<br>
    Without which there’d be nothing else to grab hold<br>
    And no time for you to react<br>
     Or the way that a candleflame requires a wick<br>
    That isn’t too slender and isn’t too thick<br>
    If the flame isn’t going to burn out too quick<br>
    Leaving only a puddle of wax<br>
                 Or the way that an inntertube needs to be patched, or replaced when the wheel has gone flat<br>
                I need you—I need you—I need you—Like that</p>

    <p>The way that a meteor dies in its birth<br>
    Destroying itself in its fall to the earth<br>
    Whose cinder is studied, given value and worth<br>
    According to what’s left in tact<br>
     Or the way that a fine wine never expires<br>
    The way satisfaction never desires<br>
    The way I’m perpetually caught in the wires<br>
    Like some circus ring acrobat<br>
                Or the way that an answer can be extremely precise without being at all exact<br>
                I love you—I love you—I love you—like that    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Your heart is set on leaving me—What am I supposed to say?<br>
    So long, I guess the pleasure’s all been mine<br>
    There’s no sense in deceiving me—it hurts, but I’ll be okay<br>
    Wounds have a way of healing, in good time<br>
                I spose I should be thanking you, for at least giving me a try<br>
                I know that a good man is hard to find<br>
    Tell me that you’re going now, but don’t let’s say goodbye<br>
    Just in case you ever change your mind—</p>

    <p>I wouldn’t want to influence—your sterling wherewithal<br>
    Nobody knows you better than yourself<br>
    I wouldn’t know just what to do with a splintered crystal ball<br>
    But what good’s it doing resting on your shelf?<br>
                You were burning in your eagerness, too confident to fail<br>
                And yet the humor in the gloom you couldn’t find<br>
    So I’ll put my house in order and blaze you out a trail<br>
    Just in case you ever change your mind</p>

    <p>Sometimes, when it begins to rain, I think of how we met<br>
    You called me by some name that wasn’t mine<br>
    and then, as you explained to me that you meant no disrespect<br>
    you hinted that perhaps it was a sign—<br>
                It seems like only yesterday, I remember it so clear <br>
                It felt as though the planets had aligned<br>
    Well, Fare thee well, and take good care; if you need me, I’ll be here—<br>
    Just in case you ever change your mind</p>

    <p>The gavel’s fell like pistol shots, the jury has come in<br>
    At some verdict it’s presumed they have arrived<br>
    But nevermind the circumstance; we both know where we’ve been <br>
    Our love was just some trial we survived<br>
                With the option to be merciful, you clung on to your grudge<br>
                You said I was too rude, too unrefined<br>
    A wiser man than I once said “Don’t be so quick to judge,<br>
    just in case you ever change your mind—”    </p>

    <h2>The Hardest Thing I Ever Done (Was Easier Than Loving You)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Words, Words, Words, 2018</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I done some things in my day that let me just say were a little less than easy to do<br>
    I been hard-pressed and hard-up on a hard-road with hard-luck, been hard-hearted one time or two<br>
    Troubles, trials, tribulations, tragedies I’ve had me a few<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you </p>

    <p>I believe I broke the record for the longest second-look<br>
    I’d have to check again, though, to see if it’s still in the Guinness book<br>
    The feat may sound incredible to some, but to me it ain’t nothing new<br>
    Cause the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you</p>

                 <p>You got a way about you babe, that just don’t know when to quit<br>
                You joined up on the losing side but defeat you just can’t admit</p>

    <p>I chose to do without them when fate offered me her jewels<br>
    I ate from the tree of knowledge knowing full well it was against the rules<br>
    I was sentenced to hard labor and now my freedom’s overdue<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n loving you</p>

    <p>I resisted false temptation when it advertised its bliss<br>
    I beat the devil at his own board-game in the wide open wilderness<br>
    I lashed myself upon the mainmast so I could hear the sirens coo<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you </p>

                <p>You got a way about you babe, you just don’t know when you’re wrong<br>
                I tell you to let go of me but you just keep on hanging on—</p>
    <p>I made wings of wax and feathers and I flapped em towards the sun<br>
    when I was still ascending the heat went ahead and melted em<br>
    as deep into the sea I sank as high above the world I flew<br>
    but the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you</p>
    <p>I climbed up Jacob’s ladder just to see what I could see<br>
    I went down into the underworld to try to set my spirit free<br>
    I held the world upon my shoulders just so Atlas could use the loo<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was eaiser’n lovin you</p>
                <p>I ain’t sayin I don’t love you, or that you ain’t worth no regard<br>
                All I’m trine to tell you babe is that sometimes lovin you is hard—</p>
    <p>I fought the famous hydra with nothing but a pocket knife<br>
    If it hadn’t been such slow going I might’ve gone and lost my life<br>
    For every head that I cut off, in its place three more grew<br>
    But the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you</p>
    <p>Now I’ve heard that love is patient, and I’ve heard that love is kind<br>
    I’ve heard that love hopes and bears all things; I’ve even heard that love is blind—<br>
    But when weighed in my own experience, I know this much is true:<br>
    the hardest thing I ever done was easier’n lovin you    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Words, Words, Words, 2018</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>before the panelist of scientists I stood defending poetry<br>
    Reciting words I’d overheard  From a magician doing sorcery <br>
    falling short of proof in court  I surrendered to His Majesty<br>
    When the jester laughed, I removed his hat  As he praised me my humility<br>
                the case dismissed from consciousness  I resumed my daily alchemy<br>
                Sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—can change your destiny</p>

    <p>As battles raged—a squire’s page  Was charged with this delivery:<br>
    To spread the news his side would lose  Without help supplied immediately<br>
    On his master’s horse he wound a course  Beyond his country’s boundary<br>
    And story goes, he took to prose  And now he writes tales for posterity<br>
                          What became of the page’s name  To this day remains a mystery<br>                  
                          Sticks and stones may break your bones But words—can alter history</p>

    <p>Wind and fog and somewhere, God, At the beginning of eternity,<br>
    commandingly said, “Let there be…”  And each question became a certainty<br>
    And there was light to pierce the night  Where darkness filled each cavity<br>
    An unseen jaw dispensing law  For motion and for gravity—<br>
                And life commenced impermanence  While Death dealt with the converse<br>
                Sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—can build a universe</p>

    <p>In days of youth I longed for truth   About love especially, I was curious<br>
    But what I know now of Love’s know-how  I only learned through inexperience<br>
    Foolish tries and compromise  Convinced me love was just a hindrance<br>
    More than to win her, what I should prefer  Is to forget or return to ignorance<br>
                “He’s mad!” you’ll say, “to feel this way—”  And I’d agree with you, regrettably <br>
                Sticks and stones can break your bones  But words—can wound a man, irreparably</p>

    <p>I did my best and knew success  It seemed a painless interlude<br>
    Between two wars in which the scores  Had been irrevocably misconstrued<br>
    Once the ghosts resumed their posts  In the countries of their summoning<br>
    I spent what I’d made in the king’s parade  And departed to my homecoming<br>
                The bridges crossed, my papers were lost, tho I wouldn’t say I lack them currently<br>
                Sticks and stones can break your bones  But words—are like a currency </p>
    <p>When asked to play, I said okay  Tho in preparing, I was meticulous<br>
    And before I’d sung, the bell had rung  And I’d been announced ridiculous<br>
    And for my prize I was ostracized  And was made to sign a covenant<br>
    but once I had, I didn’t feel so bad  to entertain them would have been a punishment<br>
                And now I’ve chewed on solitude    So long it tastes like venison<br>
                Sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—can be a medicine</p>

    <p>did a so-called crime and I paid my time  Tho the offense was considered minimal<br>
    When I got released, I thought, “I’m free, at least…”  But folks still took me for a criminal<br>
    I tried and tried my past to hide  Thought I’d escape from it eventually<br>
    But people talked and my way was blocked  Now I’m back at the penitentiary<br>
                My freedom earned, my lesson learned  I’ll tell you what now, society—<br>
                That sticks and stones may break your bones  But words—shape reality    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Words, Words, Words, 2018</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wordsWordsWords_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The D.A.’s on the front porch with the landlord behind him<br>
    Eviction notice  has been nailed to the door<br>
    Their knocking and pounding  disrupts someone calling:<br>
    “With what can I bargain when I am so poor?” <br>
     They go in and come out  dragging a person<br>
    Old man in a bathrobe  half-naked and crine<br>
    D.A. says “I’m sorry”  but he says it smiling—<br>
    “Each man’s got his labor  and don’t I got mine?”                       <br>
                You can call it your labor to ease your conscience<br>
                Call it your duty if it’ll help you sleep tight<br>
                Call it your career if you can’t tell the difference       <br>
                But callin it your job, boss—won’t make it right<br>
     The warden’s a bastard  he’s a stickler for details<br>
    Heaven have mercy  when he makes his patrol<br>
    If he finds so much as  a sheet that’s been wrinkled<br>
    You can bet that you’ll all spend  a night in the hole<br>
     He says that he loves us  there’s no need to fear him<br>
    He’d prefer we reserve all  our fear for his God<br>
    But I fear whoever  does evil so easily<br>
    And thinks that he’s only  doing a job<br>
                 Chorus<br>
     The police have shown up  in outrageous numbers<br>
    Armed in their helmets  with their nightsticks and shields<br>
    The protesters marching  are righteously singing<br>
    “we haven’t come this far  to turn back or yield”<br>
    They bring out a firehose  and turn it upon us<br>
    Transforming the marchers  into some kind of mob<br>
    Who is it you officers  swore to defend and protect?<br>
    When you put on your uniform  and made this your job?<br>
                chorus<br>
     The army recruiters  are down on the corner<br>
    They’re telling young kids bout  the splendors of war<br>
    They’re showing their medals  and telling their stories<br>
    I’d just like to ask them  what they’re fighting for<br>
     Some fight cause they have to  cause they’re under fire<br>
    Cause they’re being bullied  and they don’t get a say<br>
    But some think it’s their duty  some think it’s the right thing<br>
    To blindly take orders  and collect your pay (the American Way) <br>
                Chorus<br>
     The judge in his tower  is looking down meanly<br>
    He’s raising his gavel  and drawing his breath<br>
    He announces the sentence  he does it routinely<br>
    “You’ve been proven guilty  and your penalty’s death”<br>
     He won’t say he’s sorry  he hasn’t got pity<br>
    “Whatever you done, now, that’s between you and God,”<br>
    When he arrives home, the judge will sleep soundly<br>
    Assuring himself he’s just doing his job<br>
                 chorus      </p>

    <p>In 1492 Chris Columbus and his crew<br>
    Discovered folks a living in some islands to the west<br>
    He promised to be kind, but he went and changed his mind<br>
    Made most of them his slaves and put the rest of em to death          <br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                Perhaps the terms of his agreement wasn’t heard, heard, heard<br>
                But it’s a getting late—how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 1838 Andrew Jackson did create<br>
    A paper sayin that the natives would receive their promised land<br>
    Made a reservation zone, drove em into Oklahome<br>
    Leaving Cherokee and chocktaw blood in the Mississippi sand<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the lyin simply couldn’t have endured, -dured, -dured<br>
                But it’s a getting late—how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words? <br>
     In 1864—trine to end the civil war<br>
    Mr. Lincoln signed a paper sayin all slaves would be free<br>
    Soon as he let em go—in came the Old Jim Crow<br>
    And the rest, I’m sure you know, is US history<br>
                If I didn’t know any better, I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise has only been deferred –ferred –ferred<br>
                But it’s a getting late—how long you wanna wait<br>
                Fore you admit that a promise is just words, words, words<br>
     In August ’45—trine to keep his own alive<br>
    Harry Truman told the Japanese, “this fighting’s gotta stop,”<br>
    Any more lives bein spent, he said he would try to prevent—<br>
    Then he loaded up his atom bombs, said “Fellas, let em drop—”<br>
                If I didn’t know—any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise was always bein urged, urged, urged<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait<br>
                Fore you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 1954, in a case called Brown v. Board<br>
    The Supreme Court said that public schools must integrate their kids <br>
    They took their time, of course, with getting it enforced<br>
    And fore anything could happen, it was like nothing ever did <br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the ruling sounded too good to’ve occurred, -curred, -curred<br>
                But it’s getting late, how long you gonna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?        <br>
     In 1964, hungry for another war,<br>
    Lyndon Johnson said a US ship had been hit by Viet Cong<br>
    And though it was a lie, he still sent troops to die<br>
    In the name of keeping communism out of Vietnam<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That what ain’t democratic ain’t preferred, -ferred, -ferred <br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait <br>
                For you admit that democracy’s a word, word, word<br>
     In 1982 Ronald Regan, tride and true,<br>
    Said he’d increased public safety and on crime he waged a war<br>
    For him, tho, being safe—had to do with class and race—<br>
    Most of the folks he rounded up were young and black and poor <br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise aimed to keep us all secured, -cured, -cured<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you gonna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 1992 the war on crime and drugs just grew<br>
    Mr. Clinton said he had a plan and it would be unfurled<br>
    He built prisons left and right, filled em practically overnight<br>
    Now the US has more prisoners than any nation in the world<br>
                If I didn’t know—any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the lockdown was a bad dream that emerged, merged, merged<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     In 2001, weapons of mass destruction<br>
    Was the reason Mr. Bush supplied to re-invade Iraq<br>
    The nukes were never found, but the country was torn down<br>
    and US oil prices were a little lower after that<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose<br>
                That the promise didn’t sound quite so absurd, -surd, -surd<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait <br>
                For you admit that the promise was just words, words, words?<br>
     Now this song could go on, and on and on and on<br>
    The lies my leaders told me are too numerous to name<br>
    But I’m a getting tired, my patience is expired<br>
    As we move into the future, the song will be the same<br>
                If I didn’t know any better I’d suppose <br>
                That a government, in all things, should be just, just, just<br>
                But it’s a getting late, how long you wanna wait<br>
                For you admit if it’ll be just it’ll have to be up to us?     </p>

    <p>Yes, there’s a storm a comin, it’s on the Times front page<br>
    With a black and white photo of some kind of giant tidal wave<br>
    On account of how everybody’s gone ahead and behaved<br>
    The street preacher’s wound-up, screaming none will be saved<br>
     “By the pharaoh’s order,” cries the fouled referee,<br>
    “There’s a new law round here says that the curfew will be<br>
    From ten in the morning til quarter past three<br>
    Anybody outside after that’s gonna haveta answer to me!”<br>
     you better get your name cleared, Bluebeard, fore they make you walk the plank<br>
    Better call off your watchdogs, General, fore they all pull rank <br>
    You better get your children, Mama, bow your head and give thanks <br>
    You better grow your hair long, Samson—you gonna need your strength<br>
      You’re tween a rock and a hardplace they’re still trying to construct<br>
    When the bombs fall, Know-It-All, you better have the good sense to duck<br>
    At the rodeo, John Doe, keep your seat on that truck<br>
    and bring along your timepiece, Maurice, you gonna need some luck<br>
     well everyone’s getting bored, but I’ve already had me a few<br>
    Better take a knee, Bruce Lee, if you need something to do <br>
    It’s a sure-thing, Sherlock, but you ain’t got a clue<br>
    Aw, get out of here, Shakespeare—nobody asked you <br>
                 Chorus<br>
     Jumpin Jupiter, Lucifer, what’s become of your pride?<br>
    Didn’t anybody tell you that the sooth-sayer lied? <br>
    For a sheckel, Dr. Jeckyll, we can go for a ride<br>
    I’ll show you someplace remote where you can lay low and hide<br>
     Now I’m no Houdini and I’m no Jesse James <br>
    But you’re gonna need brass keys, Ulysses, to get out of them chains<br>
    You better smell the roses, Moses, and talk some sense to these brains<br>
    Otherwise all of your guys is gonna wind up changing their trains<br>
                 Chorus<br>
     Grow your hair long, Samson—til it’s down to your knees<br>
                Grow your hair long, Samson—til it’s long as you please<br>
                Grow your hair long, Samson—til it’s at full-length<br>
                Grow your hair long, Samson—you gonna need your strength<br>
     The doctor’s in the dentist’s chair, his tooth’s getting pulled—<br>
    Your wienereimer, Oppenheimer, has come down with a cold<br>
    I tried calling the police, the operator put me on hold<br>
    I can see your cards, Beauregard, if I were you I would fold<br>
     The captain’s gone AWOL on some binocular tour<br>
    With a lady in sales he met at the marine supply store<br>
    When the saloonkeeper’s drunk he’ll give everyone a free pour<br>
    But you better get it while you can fore he ain’t drunk anymore<br>
                 Chorus<br>
     Fare thee well, Rafael, I guess you done pretty good<br>
    They did their best to imitate you, but none of them could<br>
    Ahab took a stab and saw what was under the hood<br>
    Then he tried to say it in English—no one understood<br>
     Goldilocks needs help, she’s got her hand caught in the hive<br>
    You better be heartfelt, Mrs. Roosevelt, when you write those boys’ wives<br>
    You gonna need an editor, Senator, to keep talking that jive<br>
    It’s neither heroes nor villians, it’s just the lucky survive<br>

    <p>Who, mama, who is that great giant yonder<br>
    Who stands twenty times taller than any tree?<br>
    My child, my child, yonder’s America<br>
    They call her the Statue of Liberty<br>
     What, mama, what is that big giant tower<br>
    That starts on the ground and disappears in the air?<br>
    My child, my child, that’s just a skyscraper <br>
    You’ll probably be seeing them round here everywhere<br>
     What, mama, what is that long silver bullet<br>
    That’s snaking around on that bridge up above<br>
    My child, my child, that’s only the subway<br>
    We’ll be riding on that train soon enough<br>
     Where, mama, where did you say we were going?<br>
    How long must we wait in this subway station?<br>
    My child, my child, we’re heading to Manhattan<br>
    To the US Office of Immigration <br>
     Who, mama, who is that ragged man sleeping<br>
    There on the curb, who’s just skin and bone?<br>
    My child, my child, it’s only a hobo<br>
    Don’t point your finger, just leave him alone<br>
     Who, mama, who is that finely dressed person<br>
    Who’s fat as a king, and only short of a crown<br>
    My child, my child, that’s a rich, wealthy banker<br>
    Get out of his way or he’ll mow you right down<br>
     Why, mama, why are some people so hungry<br>
    Meanwhile there’s others that look rich in their clothes?<br>
    My child, my child, I don’t know the reason<br>
    I don’t have an answer, God only knows<br>
     Who, mama, who is that man with the night-stick<br>
    And why is that other man being beaten by him?<br>
    My child, my child, that’s only the police<br>
    In America they arrest you for having dark skin <br>
     Where, mama, where, mama—where will they take him?<br>
    will they take him to a doctor to treat his wounds and his sores?<br>
    My child, my child, they’re taking him to prison<br>
    In America that’s what they do with their poor<br>
     Ain’t mama, ain’t, mama—ain’t this a free country?<br>
    Aren’t people here given value and worth?<br>
    My child, my child—it’s only for some folks— <br>
    There’s more prisoners here than anyplace on the earth<br>
     Why, mama, why, mama—why did we come here?<br>
    What in the world did we leave our home for?<br>
    My child, my child—it just wasn’t safe there<br>
    Our country’s is facing genocide and war<br>
     Here mama, here mama, here is the building<br>
    I will wait for you here, steadfast and strong<br>
    My child, my child, I’ll just be a minute<br>
    I will go and come back—it shouldn’t take long<br>
     Why mama, why, mama—why are you crying?<br>
    Where did they tell you that we may reside?<br>
    My child, my child, they gave me no answer<br>
    But that our request to live here has been denied<br>
     Why, mama, why can’t we live in America?<br>
    Are there too many people?  Is there not enough land?<br>
    My child, my child, it’s the people in charge here<br>
    They hate and they fear what they don’t understand<br>
     When, mama, when will we be accepted?<br>
    When will this hatred be brought to a close?<br>
    My child, my child—I don’t have an answer<br>
    I don’t have an answer, God only knows    </p>

    <p>You crossed a black cat’s path when you encountered me<br>
    Somebody should have said  this here was a carnival<br>
    The only way out again’s  back through the livingroom<br>
    Which you were just driven from  on account of your destiny<br>
    You, with your vacant heart  throwing your weight around<br>
    Just like you owned the joint  or like you knew someone<br>
    Making your crass remarks  into their fold-out smiles<br>
    As all of their watches chimed  and somewhere a sailor drowned<br>
     Tears like a jet-streamed sky  raking your made-up face<br>
    I caught a glimpse of you  inside the hallway meer<br>
    You looked like a vagabond  you looked like a stolen wife<br>
    Or what is the word for it?  you looked simply out of place<br>
     And as the hostess rose  shouting her lover’s name<br>
    Crying for ornaments  and for a tablecloth<br>
    I saw how you fell apart  then gathered up yourself<br>
    You puttem all to shame, you puttem all to shame<br>
                II<br>
    Just as the matador  flung off his captain’s cape<br>
    in preparation for  some kind of ritual<br>
    the astronaut cleared his throat  as if he would make a toast<br>
    then he restrained himself  with a whole roll of plumber’s tape<br>
     “I don’t care what the bible says,”  shouted the bathroom stall<br>
    addressing the minister  distributing sacraments<br>
    Out of a purse he stole  out of the parsonage<br>
    Pardoning pilferage  at no extra charge at all<br>
     Back at the ranch meanwhile  nobody’d moved a bone<br>
    The sheriff was flinging cards  into a hangman’s noose<br>
    The deputy watched a fly  buzzin around the room<br>
    Drew back the velvet drapes  looked out at a parking cone<br>
     A fat lady stood and belched  saluted the flag and sang:<br>
    Somewhere a child is born  somewhere a child dies<br>
    Nobody looks at you  they don’t think you’re beautiful<br>
    But you puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
                 You puttem all to shame, just like a needle plunging into a vein <br>
                That carries the antidote that’s full of the cure from the heart to the brain<br>
                You puttem all to shame—<br>
                III<br>
    Lord Alfred makes his rounds  handing out red balloons<br>
    Asking for tickets, please  saying Please Watch Your Step <br>
    Producing a handkerchief  dripping with turpentine<br>
    Peddling silverware  and stopping to smell the fumes<br>
     The emperor’s crown’s been caught  over the mantelpiece<br>
    A bystander claimed it was  made out of mistletoe<br>
    Lonely men gathered round  waiting for girls to come<br>
    The pianist blew trombone  his requiem masterpiece <br>
     The sofa is filling up  like it was a safety boat<br>
    With politician’s wives  and the offspring of janitors<br>
    There was a pack of dogs  I think they were Sherlock Holmes’<br>
    Charging the drawbridge doors  molesting an overcoat<br>
     And you in your pleated skirt  looking so torn apart<br>
    How did your hair get wet?  it’s not even raining out<br>
    I could have kissed you then  you would have hated me<br>
    You puttem all to shame, you puttem all to shame<br>
     IV<br>
     Up at the podium  the weatherman prophesies<br>
    all bets are off this year  blaming technology<br>
    The postman has been delayed  due to the hurricane<br>
    Just then some legs walked in  in search of a centipede <br>
     the judge entered, wig-and-all  some people stood and cheered<br>
    others threw fruit at him  others forget-me-nots<br>
    his gavel was in his hand  his sword hanging by his side<br>
    his breath smelled of bubblegum  bacon grease in his beard<br>
     and people have asked before  what is it I see in you<br>
    I always respond to them  well isn’t it obvious?<br>
    You held a parasol  under a chandelier <br>
    You lit your cigarette  in the coals of a barbecue<br>
     It was your corkscrew gaze  meeting my tailspin frame<br>
    that was the moment when  I knew you were the one<br>
    they were the best of theirs  you were no match for them <br>
    you put em all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
                 you puttem all to shame, just like a lost child that nobody claims<br>
                whose manifest radiance is offered to everyone and then goes down the drain<br>
     V<br>
     serpentine pedagogues  brandishing chilled vermouth<br>
    using their intellects  as if they were hand-grenades<br>
    Sodom is burning down  there’s firetrucks everywhere<br>
    And Socrates’ dies tonight  for trying to corrupt the youth<br>
     head like a pile of rocks  face like a punching-bag<br>
    nobody thinks I’m cute  narcissus vainly wines  <br>
    he asks the river who  is fairest of them all?<br>
    the one with the stupid hat  that looks like a launching-pad<br>
     Mathematicians trade  stories with psychopaths<br>
    About what is possible  in the grand scheme of things<br>
    The psychopath wants to know  whether it’s feasible<br>
    The metaphysicians claim  it really just basic math<br>
     Eventually you’re convinced  Chess is a bachelor’s game<br>
    The neighbors are victims of  suburban piracy<br>
    Going from door to door  Showing their business-cards<br>
    You puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     VI<br>
     you move through the marketplace  like you was a stranger there<br>
    taking a hold of things  asking how much is this?<br>
    If a wheelbarrow full of cash  is the price of a loaf of bread<br>
    What will you pay to me  to relinquish my rockingchair?<br>
     Or cut to the figurines  dancing in silhouette<br>
    one dressed in corduroys  one in a diamond suit<br>
    the princess of India  in the arms of a scalawag<br>
    whose playing the fool tonight  trying to pirouette<br>
     Down in the lower depths  beneath the catacombs<br>
    Echoes of subway trains  hurtling overhead<br>
    The hands of a claustrophobe  touching the hands of God <br>
    Wound up in heavy chains  reaching for help and home<br>
     Robin Hood checks his gauge  flawlessly changes lanes<br>
    Everyone beeps at him  tells him where he can go<br>
    From his perspective though  these are just bumper cars<br>
    You puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     VII<br>
     I watched you donning masks  out in the alleyways<br>
    Practicing tones of voice  under a crescent moon<br>
    You were the mermaid queen  tossing a skipping stone<br>
    Into a sea of sand  a valley of microwaves <br>
     Someone was guiding me  they must’ve got lost, I guess<br>
    Out in the wilderness  look at that burning bush<br>
    I heard what sounded like  a wandering pack of wolves<br>
    pathetically fingernailed  clawing a dead-man’s chest<br>
     Next time I pass this way  better have your eyes peeled<br>
    Stuck in their sockets like  they was a pair of bulbs<br>
    I’ll be in desperate straits  I’ll be insane with grief <br>
    Dragging a tire-swing  out of a potter’s field <br>
     somebody threw himself  off the midnight Express<br>
    they said it was suicide  it was indisputable<br>
    nobody knew him though  he claimed to be everyone<br>
    you puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     VIII<br>
     the referee’s missing tooth  turned up in a boxingglove<br>
    that was inside the wedding-cake  they sent to the funeral<br>
    the one that read: Warmst Regards  From All of Us Back Home<br>
    depicting a concubine  dispensing a mother’s love<br>
     and as the warden waits  examining old brochures <br>
    that advertised Michigan  that spoke of an afterlife<br>
    the inmates are at their bars  releasing their mourning doves<br>
    that’re seen from the passing bus  offering city-tours <br>
     Mother Teresa writes  in an old-fashioned style<br>
    An overdue letter to  a boyfriend across the sea<br>
    Enclosing a photograph  in which she is posing nude<br>
    Saying, Next time you come  why don’t you stay awhile?<br>
     And here’s Satan’s latest prize  the one with the swollen brain<br>
    Riding the chariot  into the stadium’s mouth<br>
    What are you waiting for?  who are you hiding from?<br>
    you puttem all to shame  you puttem all to shame<br>
     IX<br>
     the inferno calmly climbs  up on a bail of hay<br>
    Inviting martyrdom  down from its pedestal<br>
    the difference tween them and you’s  same as the difference tween<br>
    a woman that’s made of flesh  and one that’s just made of clay<br>
     You came down the spiral stair  the way I’ve seen waterfall<br>
    Or like a shooting star  or like sinking hope<br>
    you had your hat on square  all perpendicular<br>
    you spoke in pentameter  like some kind of know it all<br>
    suddenly here we are  inside the final ring<br>
    Here at the empty room  here at the final hour<br>
    Traitors are telling lies  trying to avoid the blame<br>
    Elderly couples sit  fondly remembering<br>
     I wrote, “Dear Beatrice,”  like I had forgot your name<br>
    Composing my epitaph  using a ball-point pen<br>
    and for the hundredth time  inside a half-an-hour<br>
    you puttem all to shame   you puttem all to shame    </p>

    <h2>Absalom - Part 1</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>King David and his concubines begat between them several sons<br>
    And of the lot, none there were more handsome than the one they called—<br>
    Absalom was brother to a younger sister named Tamar<br>
    In all the kingdom that was known, none there were more fair than she<br>
    Tamar was prized by many men who meant to win her as a bride<br>
    Not exempting the king’s firstborn, Amnon was what he was called.<br>
    By feigning he was ill one day, Amnon lured Tamar to him<br>
    And when she came to nurse his cold, he seized her strongly by the arm<br>
    “Why have you taken hold of me? Wherefore this sudden strength of yours?<br>
    Do you intend that I should lie with you? What ever do you take me for?”<br>
    And what Tamar refused to yield, Amnon cruelly took by force<br>
    And hoping he was someplace near, Tamar called out her brother’s name:<br>
                A——————Absalom!—where, O where, can you be? <br>
                A——————Absalom!—would that you were here to rescue me </p>
 
    <p>When Absalom received the news that Amnon had his sister raped<br>
    He was angry but he did not act, he said, “Let us see what the king will do.”<br>
    When David did receive the news, bitter and angry did he turn<br>
    But no penalty would he dole, for Amnon was his firstborn son.<br>
    So Absalom conceived a plan to take revenge upon Amnon<br>
    And when two years had run their course, he held a banquet at his house.<br>
    And all the while he hid his hate he felt for Amnon and his Sin<br>
    Meanwhile caring for Tamar who resolved to show her face no more.<br>
    When Amnon was drunk with wine, Absalom shouted, “The time has come!”<br>
    And all his servants rose at once and Amnon with their swords did slay.<br>
    And as he fell beneath their blades, outnumbered and without defense<br>
    And as his spirit left his flesh, these words was Amnon heard to say:<br>
                Absalom!—with my last breath, your life I’ll curse <br>
                Absalom!—this death is bad; may yours be worse     </p>

    <p>God made the world in six short days<br>
    On the seventh he took a rest<br>
    On the eighth he woke up in a mood<br>
    Said, “I wonder what I’ll do next—”<br>
    He watched men work together<br>
    To build a tower that went up a mile<br>
    When it seemed there’d be no stopping them<br>
    God grinned and said, “I know, I’ll—</p>
 
    <p>Burn it down—down—down—down<br>

    Humble Abraham stepped in<br>
    “If there’s one worthwhile man living there<br>

    That the search would prove a futile one<br>
    It couldn’t be long denied—<br>
    And when the time had come and gone<br>
    Abe surrendered and replied:<br>

    <p>Samson was the strongest man<br>
    That ever walked the earth<br>
    He loved Delilah even though<br>
    She was a Philistine by birth<br>
    She betrayed him for her people’s sake<br>
    And cut off all his hair<br>
    It grew back in his captivity<br>
    And then he burst right out of there, to<br>

    <p>Old John Brown was tried and hanged<br>
    By now his story you’ve probly heard:<br>
    How on the scaffold he did stand<br>
    To speak his final words:<br>
    “When law and conscience don’t agree<br>
    That’s when you’ve gotta stand and fight<br>
    I don’t regret a single thing I done—<br>

    <p>I could see through the rearview<br>
    I was no longer near you<br>
    I could no longer hear you <br>
    no matter how hard I tried</p>
 
    <p>you seemed to be distant<br>
    here and gone in an instant<br>
    just to stay for a short stint<br>
    just along for the ride</p>
 
    <p>you asked for directions<br>
    and you took up collections<br>
    didn’t need no protectin<br>
    your plans were all drawn</p>
 
    <p>I could tell you were tired<br>
    Not exactly inspired<br>
    Though you know I admired<br>
    How long you held on</p>

    <h2>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Once pon a time in a faraway place there lived two young boys with their father<br>
    One was in charge of keeping the sheep, in charge of everything else was his brother<br>
    The shepherd was told to keep his eyes peeled, to look out for wolves with their cunning<br>
    Was told if he saw anything that looked strange, to yell, and the villiage’d come running<br>
    For a while he did just like he was told, but he found the watch rather boring<br>
    So one quiet night he raised the alarm while the entire villiage was snoring:</p>
 
    <p>Wolf! There’s a wolf! O, somebody help!<br>
                Somebody please, I ain’t lyin<br>
                Get up from your beds, you been sleepin too long<br>
                Cant anyone hear me cryin?</p>
 
    <p>So up from their beds the villiagers arose, hoping to prevent some disaster<br>
    But when they got to the boy with their pitchforks and blades, they found he was dyin of                                                                                                                                    laughter<br>
    “You idiot boy,” his father exclaimed, “Didn’t I raise you to know better?”<br>
    Than to behave just like a fool? Why can’t you be more like your brother?”<br>
    “I’m sorry,” he said, “won’t happen again,” and on he went pologizing<br>
    But the very next night when the town was asleep, a cry from the fields it came rising</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>So up from their beds the villagers arose, hoping to prevent some disaster<br>
    And when they got to the boy with their pitchforks and blades, they found him there dyin                                                                                                                                    of laughter<br>
    “Fooled us again, shame on us,” they said, “We really ought to have known better,”<br>
    And they all went away shaking their heads, wishing the boy was more like his brother<br>
    The very next night, a wolf, it appeared; the boy saw it but he raised no holler<br>
    He managed to chase it away from his flock into the house of his brother</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>But no one got up tho the screams they all heard, thought, “it’s only that boy who’s been<br>
                                                                                                                                        lyin,”
    <p>and everyone slept with wax in their ears while the innocent one went on dyin<br>
    next morning the father asked his son, “Son, tell me, where is your brother?”<br>
    the boy replied, “How am I sposed to know? Am I my brother’s keeper?”    </p>

    <p>Death was out riding his horse in the desert<br>
    When he happened upon two traveling men<br>
    One of them saw his face in the distance<br>
    And took off back the way they had come</p>
 
    <p>When Death made his way within range of the other<br>
    He tipped his hat and said, “it’s alright—<br>
    He said, “I’m only surprised to find him all the way out here<br>
    We’ve an appointment in town tonight,” </p>
 
    <p>Now I used to know where it was I was going<br>
    My life had purpose, direction and aim—<br>
    But somewhere I lost my defense against knowing<br>
    That in the end you wind up losing the game </p>
 
    <p>You can never escape it, outrun it, outsmart it<br>
    It’s like a storm that’s hanging over the sea—<br>
    O but cant I be devoured without being required<br>
    to worship what’s swallowing me?</p>
 
    <p>maybe you’re a little more discerning<br>
                and you already know what I’m still learning<br>
                and you’ve extinguished what I’ve been burning</p>
                            a long, long time, to know
 
    <p>but given the option between staying and moving<br>
                saying and doing<br>
                begging and choosing—<br>
                I’ll do whichever brings me quickest to ruin—I’m only human, you know </p>
 
    <p>I am the prodigal son’s younger brother<br>
    Who stayed home and tended the flock<br>
    Who, despite having dreams of his own to accomplish, stayed<br>
    Only to wind up the laughingstock;</p>
 
    <p>I am not perfect—no one is perfect<br>
    But perfection plagues the rational soul<br>
    That is always trying to realize that trying<br>
    To realize isn’t even the goal</p>
 
    <p>Prick my finger—I will show you my bloodline<br>
    Tickle me, and I may smile<br>
    Poison me and I’ll accuse you of something<br>
    And die, reluctantly, after a while</p>
 
    <p>I feel the want of generations before me<br>
    I pre-curse all the sorrow to come<br>
    For all of our time here, we have done nothing—<br>
    So long as work is yet to be done</p>
 
    <p>But maybe you’re a hair more saintly<br>
                Or maybe you just don’t hear so faintly<br>
                But we’re all sorta rotten—ain’t we?—</p>
                            And we reap the seeds that we sew—
 
    <p>Given the option between hurting and healing<br>
                Standing and kneeling<br>
                Buying and stealing<br>
                I’ll do whichever keeps me under the ceiling—I’m only human, you know </p>
 
    <p>Jesus Christ was sent here to save us<br>
    With a message and a couple of tricks<br>
    wherever he went he encountered a creature<br>
    that struck him as too broken to fix</p>
 
    <p>he once asked to please be relieved of his mission<br>
    he said, “nobody here understands,<br>
    Everyone thinks I’m chosen and special<br>
    I keep telling them, I’m only a man—”</p>
 
    <p>He died on a Friday, lay dead on a Saturday<br>
    On Sunday morning he rose<br>
    When they rolled the stone away from his coffin<br>
    all they found were what remained of his clothes</p>
 
    <p>two fellas out on their way to Emmaus<br>
    saw him and said there’s more to retrieve,<br>
    jesus said, “even if you manage to get their attention<br>
    you’ll have to die just to make them believe,”</p>
 
    <p>but maybe you’ll be more successful<br>
                when your angel pulls you in to wrestle<br>
                and you won’t have to sink the vessel—just to make still waters flow</p>
 
    <p>but given the option between staying and leaving<br>
                giving and recieving<br>
                nothing and grieving <br>
                I’ll take whichever staunches the bleeding—I’m only human, you know</p>
 
    <p>And so here we are on the eve of adventure<br>
    The brink of destruction, the moment of goodbye<br>
    Nothing is happening, but a faucet is leaking<br>
    And darkness is filling the sky</p>
 
    <p>And you want to know if tomorrow I’ll be here<br>
    Right where you leave me, here in the door like this<br>
    And I want to know if this isn’t your clever way<br>
    Of telling me my chance has been missed</p>
 
    <p>So go to your bretheren, return to your battlefield<br>
    Take whatever strength you got left<br>
    Your cards are all showing now, you’ve been holding them clumsily<br>
    Close to the wound at your chest</p>
 
    <p>Perhaps you’ll think less of me, but perhaps that’s reality<br>
    And you ought not to go building up myths<br>
    Sometimes the tools that you use to escape yourself<br>
    Become the chains you imprison it with</p>
 
    <p>But maybe I’m just too ill-tempered<br>
                Sophomoric and self-centered<br>
                To recognize that the race I’ve entered</p>
                            Has been traveling much too slow
 
    <p>But given the option between flying and falling<br>
                Lying and sprawling—crying and bawling<br>
                I’ll do whichever proves itself as my calling—I’m only human, you know    </p>

    <p>I could be outcast, outnumbered and outlawed<br>

    If I was sore and couldn’t bare your touch<br>
    If for whatever reason it just got to be too much<br>
    It got to be more than I could endure</p>
 
    <p>If I lost that which I could not retrieve<br>
    And only felt what I couldn’t perceive<br>
    If I knew you weren’t –I’d still believe<br>
    Anyway, that you were</p>

    <h2>The Ballad of Judas Iscariot</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 7</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>My name it is an epitaph, my tale it is too sad to tell<br>
    For I have done the hangman’s math, when I leave this earth, I’m bound for hell.<br>
    I started out a fisherman, I spent my youth beside the sea<br>
    Until one day a shepherd came, said, “Put down thy nets and come with me.”<br>
    He folded me into his flock and taught me how to serve the poor<br>
    My faith in him was like a rock, until it wasn’t anymore.<br>
    For many years I followed him, one lost sheep wandring with the rest<br>
    But alone to me he’d often said I was the one he loved the best.<br>
    And as we roamed the country fair, and preached the good news from on high<br>
    The authorities, they did declare, “He is gaining strength, and so he must die!”<br>
    And late one night I dreamed a dream, an angel came and spoke to me<br>
    He said I was the dark machine that was mentioned in the prophesy.<br>
    He told me how to play my part, said, “Altho you love him to the rind,<br>
    You must betray him in your heart, so that he can save mankind.”<br>
    And when I wakened from my spell, my faint resolve began to grow<br>
    But whether it was from God or Hell—that is something I will never know.<br>
    I sought the high-priest to inquire, “What will you give for Jesus Christ?”<br>
    He gave the sum and went no higher, “Thirty silver pieces for his life.”<br>
    At supper on the final night, he spoke and said he already knew<br>
    He’d been betrayed and he’d lose the fight, he said, “I know that it was one of you.”<br>
    Around that room, denials poured as all our faces turned to red<br>
    “It wasn’t me, I swear, my Lord,” and Jesus: “Yeah, so you have said.”<br>
    That night I brought the sentries round, and as if to add insult to my sin,<br>
    When I kissed him on the ground, they paid me right in front of him.<br>
    He went before the judge and court, was mocked and sentenced then to die,<br>
    They hung him up upon the cross where he was flogged and crucified.<br>
    And worst of all that did transpire, worse than any guilt I own<br>
    Worse than hell’s eternal fire, were his last words to me alone:<br>
    As he was tortured, stabbed and maimed, as blood from his fresh wounds did spew<br>
    He looked at me, and said, “Be not ashamed—for already I have forgiven you.”<br>
    And saying that, he hung his head, as if to pray or give a nod<br>
    And when someone cried: “Enough—he’s dead,” they knew he was the Son of God.<br>
    No trial am I made to stand, no jury aims to see me hung<br>
    But I don’t think people understand just what it is that I have done.<br>
    I didn’t do it out of hate, out of malice, greed or jealousy—<br>
    I did it cause it was his fate, and because it was my destiny.<br>
    My name, it is Iscariot, I betrayed the Savior, Jesus Christ<br>
    My conscience cannot carry it: Thirty Silver Pieces for my life.     </p>

    <p>It’s seven degrees, I got no place to go<br>
    This time tomorrow, it’ll be ten below<br>
    Sun’s going down, it’s starting to snow<br>
    Lord have mercy on me<br>
    Lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>I’ve made my mistakes and I’ve got my regrets<br>
    Dug my own grave as I was placing those my bets<br>
    And now I ain’t got the money for to pay off my debts<br>
    Lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>My friends want me placed under arrest<br>
    My family agrees, and thinks it’d be for the best<br>
    To whom can I turn, now?  There’s nobody left—<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>Have mercy on me—tho I now am trembling<br>
                And did not do my daily share<br>
    Have mercy on me—and in thy remembering<br>
                Recall how frequent was my prayer</p>
 
    <p>others came to me, helpless, I kicked them to the curb<br>
    I took offense at their entitlement, gall and their nerve<br>
    I know this, now, is justice, it’s what I deserve, but<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>I have fled every place that I might’ve stayed<br>
    Conceded to fold right when I should have played<br>
    Is this here not the fate of which I’ve been so afraid?<br>
    Lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>It’s one thing I’ll mention of which I’m ashamed<br>
    I can’t seem to shoulder my own share of the blame<br>
    Stead of pitying myself, why can’t I just change?<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>Have mercy on me—tho the cost were too high<br>
                And the debt one more I could not repay      <br>
                Have mercy on me—so that rather than die<br>
                I can turn the favor someone else’s way</p>
 
    <p>Wherever there’s injustice, there’s histry to blame<br>
    I profit from the system I been fighting to change<br>
    But how can I be free when my brother’s in chains?<br>
    Lord Have Mercy on me!</p>
 
    <p>I feel like the ending is about to begin;<br>
    Ceiling’s coming down and the wall’s closing in<br>
    The wind’s picking up; the light’s getting dim<br>
    lord have mercy on me</p>
 
    <p>The future’s been told in decipherable font<br>
    the past is a vessel the dead failed to haunt<br>
    teach me know what it’s important to want—<br>
    Lord, have mercy on me</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks<br>
    Opinions are too hard to turn<br>
    But I say try it and see what sticks—<br>
    It ain’t never too late to learn</p>
 
    <p>I used to want to play the guitar<br>
    I thought I couldn’t cause I didn’t know how<br>
    Then I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and—<br>
    I think I’m getting the hang of hit now</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Our government’s got the strange idea<br>
    That private healthcare we all can afford<br>
    I guess the lawmakers have never either never been sick—<br>
    Or else they’ve never been poor</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Our government’s got the funny idea<br>
    that they’ve met all the public school needs<br>
    with teachers making less than a decent wage<br>
    there’s plenty left for the war overseas</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>There’s folks in this land who are full up of hate<br>
    Seems anger is all that they’ve got<br>
    They spread their harmful and hateful ideas<br>
    Exactly the way they were taught</p>
 
    <p>Don’t know about you but I’m starting to think<br>
    Maybe everybody’s to blame<br>
    Instead of trying to be right all the time<br>
    Why don’t we try being nice for a change?</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Some people think it’s too early to say<br>
    Some people think it’s already too late<br>
    Some say it’d be easier to move the sea with a spoon<br>
    Than to change the mind of the State</p>
 
    <p>Politicians got mouths, some got ears<br>
    Long as you got the money to burn<br>
    That’s the only time you’ll hear one of them say<br>
    “It ain’t never too late to learn”</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Jesus arrived at the banker’s hall<br>
    Their tables he did overturn<br>
    He said, “I guess none of y’all’ve caught on yet—<br>
    But it ain’t never too late to learn”    </p>

    <h2>Absalom - Part 2</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Only Human, 2019</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#onlyHuman_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>When Amnon’s life was smothered out, Absalom to his horse did take<br>
    For he knew that when his deed was known, he’d be the enemy of the state<br>
    And so began his long career as a fugitive and a refugee<br>
    Wherein he learned a thing or two about how common people lived.<br>
    And as he roamed from town to town and shared the campfires of the poor<br>
    He more than once revealed his tale and made his royal bloodlines known.<br>
    In time he gained some confidence, and did a reputation earn<br>
    For seeming just as fit to rule as, if not moreso than the king.<br>
    And into his mind there came a thought, which he did often speak aloud<br>
    “I wish my father wasn’t king—would that it had been me instead!” <br>
    When David did receive the news, bitter and angry did he turn<br>
    But no penalty would he dole, for Absalom was yet his son.<br>
    So David stood before his throng and asked the crowds that he could see<br>
    “Who among you would challenge me?”—the reply returned resoundingly: <br>
                Absalom!—what else is there now to discuss? <br>
                Absalom!—he has won the hearts of all of us! </p>
 
    <p>And so it came that Absalom conspired to overtake the throne<br>
    He raised an army of good men, it numbered many thousand strong.<br>
    When David did receive the news, a sadness overwhelmed his heart—<br>
    For though he’d been to war before, he’d not yet fought a son he loved.<br>
    So when the day of battle came, the King gave the orders to his men:<br>
    “though treacherous, my son is mine—if captured, please do spare his life.” <br>
    And as his men prepared to ride, King David said, “I will go, too.”<br>
    But Joab, David’s right-hand-man, replied, “No such thing shall you do.”<br>
    And forth both armies rode that day, their conflicts to resolve with war<br>
    and both sides suffered massive loss—twenty thousand died in all.<br>
    And Absalom among them died, his life concluding in this way:<br>
    As he was riding through the woods, he was clotheslined by an oak-tree branch<br>
    And tween the earth and sky he hung, for some while struggling to get loose<br>
    When upon his dangling form, rode Joab, David’s right-hand-man.  <br>
    And as the men of David’s force recalled to him the oath they made<br>
    Joab recounted all the slain, and said “—with this man’s life a debt is paid!”<br>
    And saying so he took three spears and stabbed them through the young man’s chest<br>
    and in this way was slain the son their beloved king had loved the best.<br>
    Then Joab sent two messengers back home to tell the tale world-wide<br>
    The first, that they had won the war, the second, that Absalom had died.<br>
    And all the people cheered with joy to know there had been victory<br>
    But David simply hung his head and wept bitter tears of misery<br>
    “What’s the cheering of ten thousand strong? What’s all the joy of battles won?<br>
    Compared to this deep grief I feel to be deprived of my beloved son?<br>
                Absalom!—my son, my son!  My son is dead! <br>
                Absalom!—would it had been me instead!”    </p>

    <p>Your eyes look heavy, your shirts stained with tears<br>
    You look like you aint had a good night’s rest in years<br>
    The evening is young yet, but the morning, she nears<br>
    All that lies in darkness soon will be made clear— <br>
                you can lose the burden, add your complaints to the pile<br>
                Why don’t you take your coat off and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>You look like you just seen the worst part of a brawl<br>
    I’d hate to see the other guy, if he even made it out at all<br>
    Youre on your last legs, with your back gainst the wall<br>
    If you try to move you know you’re just gonna fall<br>
                But seeing you try, man, you know it just makes me smile<br>
                Why don’t you take off your coat—and stay awhile? </p>
 
    <p>I got friends in low places, I got enemies close-by<br>
    I could tell you some stories that’d make you laugh til you cry<br>
    You can’t win em all, but you know you can try<br>
    But I ain’t sellin nothing that you don’t wanna buy <br>
                I ain’t gonna pressure you out of your own denial<br>
                Why don’t you take your coat off and stay awhile</p>
 
    <p>Can I fix for you a cup of something warm<br>
    While you dry off, take shelter from the storm?<br>
    The sails right off of their riggings have torn<br>
    Anything that needs doing’ll have to wait til the morn<br>
                your troubles out there are lined up in single file<br>
                why don’t you—take off your coat, and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>Wipe your muddy boots off, hang up your dusty hat<br>
    You’re makin me nervous pacing the floor like that<br>
    the bus is busted, the wheels have gone flat<br>
    there engine’s been burned up, along with the map <br>
                even if we were able, I wouldn’t drive one more mile<br>
                why don’t you—take your coat off, stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>you can make yourself at home, here, do just as you please<br>
    it’ll be morning fore the jailer gets back with the keys<br>
    the guards have gone home, soldiers stand at ease <br>
    You can do whatever you like—anything except leave<br>
                Ain’t nobody in here gonna put you on trail<br>
                Why don’t you—take off your coat and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>You don’t need to get angry, we’re all in the same boat<br>
    It’s not like anyone put our fates to a vote<br>
    It’s a dog-eat-dog world, and that’s all that she wrote<br>
    If it don’t make a good story, it’ll make a fine anecdote<br>
                I’ll even tell it to you, long as you don’t touch that dial<br>
                Why don’t you—take your coat off, and stay awhile?</p>
 
    <p>I also have struggled, I ain’t no different from you<br>
    Had all of my money strung up in my shoe<br>
    Had everything stolen from me a time or two<br>
    Had to start over, and relearn all that I knew<br>
                Be not afraid of me, honey, be reconciled—<br>
                Why don’t you—take off your coat, and stay awhile?    </p>

    <p>Met a cloud passin overhead through the windowpane right beside my bed<br>
    “Hello down there, are you,” it said, “Alive?”<br>
    I said “How am I to tell, sometimes I look alright when I feel like hell<br>
    I guess I’m doin well—enough to get by”</p>
 
    <p>I met a tree out on highway nine, a lone handsome ponderosa pine<br>
    He said he wished he had legs like mine so he could run<br>
    I said I’ll give you these here boots if you teach me how to lay down roots<br>
    He said sometimes there’s substitutes, but this just aint one</p>
 
    <p>And isn’t it just my luck—soon as I get goin, the goin get’s tough<br>
                Lose my shoes and the road gets rough on me again<br>
                I bet it all and they call my bluff, they leave me fifty cents when I need a buck<br>
                And I’m just trine to get out of bein stuck right where I am</p>
                            I’m still standin in the same spot where I began
                            Cept I’m sunk now a little bit deeper in the sand
                            And I’m cryin out for help cause I need a hand
                            You know I’ll return the favor someday, if I can
 
    <p>I met a doctor who was ill, who said it was only a matter of time until<br>
    The disease would begin to kill him or itself<br>
    He asked me what my trouble was, I said I’m just waitin for my bell to buzz<br>
    And even if it never does, at least I got my health</p>
 
    <p>I met a lady in a turquoise hat, she asked me a few questions about this and that<br>
    And in 30 seconds flat she forgot my name<br>
    She told me her biography, along with most of the whole world’s history<br>
    And for what escaped her memory she felt ashamed</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I got a pen that just won’t write, got a pack of matches, not a one will light<br>
    I got a song for you tonight, but it won’t make you stay<br>
    I got a knife that just won’t cut, a refrigerator door that won’t stay shut<br>
    I got a lot of things here, but what good are they?</p>
 
    <p>I got one eye that just won’t blink, got a thirst I can’t quench with just one drink<br>
    I got a brain that just can’t think it’s troubles through<br>
    I got a parrot that won’t repeat, got a hunger in me that just don’t wanna eat<br>
    I got a heart that just won’t beat for no one else but you</p>

    <p>Moved to the city the other day,<br>
    Less to be there than to get away<br>
    I got a quarter of the space I had, and the rent it costs a pile<br>
    My roommates all work through the night<br>
    Come home at dawn put out the lights<br>
                 Sleep all day and all afternoon<br>
                Wake up again when they can see the moon<br>
                Their trash all through the apartment’s strewn<br>
                They say I’ll be like them pretty soon <br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city—for a while </p>
 
    <p>Time came when I should’ve wrote<br>
    I sent a postcard to my folks<br>
    Dear Ma, I’m so depressed I’ve forgotten how to smile<br>
    Nobody knows my name<br>
    And every day is about the same<br>
                The sun comes up and the sun goes down<br>
                People just trine to move around<br>
                Everybody wears a frown<br>
                You say hello, they look at the ground<br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city—for a while</p>
 
    <p>My coat’s dirty, tattered, torn<br>
    My pants is old and warped and worn<br>
    My boots is so full up of holes and get worse with every mile<br>
    Walkin round here and there<br>
    It’s hard to make it most anywhere<br>
                Trucks a honkin, trolley’s squeakin<br>
                Trains a rumbling, cars a beepin<br>
                At 3 am the neighbor’s screamin<br>
                Fore you know it, I’ll be leavin<br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city—for a while</p>
 
    <p>I was bred in the place I’m from<br>
    But here I feel just like a crumb<br>
    When you’re used to woods and mountains, the city’s what seems wild<br>
    Sometimes people start to yell<br>
    What at, though, you can’t always tell<br>
                Hey—what’re you lookin at?<br>
                Hey—how are you doin, cat?<br>
                What do you know? How bout that? <br>
                Look out you don’t step on that rat    <br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city for a while</p>
 
 
    <p>A good job has been hard to find<br>
    That’ll keep you out of the daily grind<br>
    Every morning its like herded sheep, all in single file<br>
    The workers come in from outside<br>
    In a car or bus or train they ride<br>
                The builders build the buildings tall<br>
                Back you right up against the wall<br>
                Make you feel that you’re pretty small<br>
    Til you got no room to yourself at all<br>
    I think I gotta get out of the city for a while</p>
 
    <p>Folks tell me in a while I’ll see<br>
    A change start to come over me<br>
    You’ll still think you’re miserable but you’ll just be in denial<br>
    You’ll get away for a week or two<br>
    Go to the shore, take in the view<br>
                Youll miss the sidewalks and the throng<br>
    They’ll sing to you like a siren-song<br>
    You’ll see you’ve loved it all along<br>
                You’ll start to feel like something’s wrong:<br>
    You’ll think you gotta get back to the city for a while    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The time now has come for facing the facts, our love has grown cold to the touch<br>
    We’re giving it everything that we have and our best still ain’t good enough<br>
    Perhaps I’m to blame for trying too hard to make this into something it wasn’t<br>
    For making the case that it matters to you when both of us know that it doesn’t<br>
    But who knows in spite of all that went wrong, it might still have turned out okay<br>
    If you hadn’t a snagged me and dragged me along every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>You don’t have to make like you’re really upset, you don’t have to tell me you’re sorry<br>
    You don’t gotta act like it’s the end of the world, it’s only the end of our story<br>
    I can’t really say that I’m glad it occurred, but I won’t say I’m sorry it’s over<br>
    The things about me that you still haven’t heard are probably best left undiscovered<br>
    But you never know somehow we might’ve pulled thru, might’ve even gotten married someday<br>
    If you hadn’t a lived like you’d nothing to lose, every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>I like to believe I can account for my part more than only part of the time<br>
    That what looks like a fault’s just a lapse in attention rather than a flaw in design<br>
    The vultures that swooped down to feed on my spleen were merely doing what they were made to<br>
    The leeches that drained me and sucked my bones clean shouldn’t have frightened or phased you<br>
    And as for the demons that hounded my heart, you know I could’ve kept em at bay<br>
    If you hadn’t a pushed me and pulled me apart, every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>You said you were tired of having this fight, the one that always ends in confusion<br>
                With one of us kissing the other goodnight and returning to the routine illusion<br>
                The picture in glass that hangs on your wall, the one in which everyone’s laughin<br>
                Seems to account for how I can recall events that never actually happened<br>
                But even with my head in a fog, I might’ve made it out of the gray<br>
                If you hadn’t a thrown a wrench in the cog every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>From now on I’ll do my best to be fair whenever telling people about us<br>
                I’ll say that our roads ran together awhile and then quite simply went on without us<br>
                You’ve taken your portion and dealt out your share of insults and harmful lines<br>
                if you’ve told me once I’m an old so-and-so, then you’ve told me a thousand times<br>
                And who knows, even in spite of the odds, we might’ve overcome the forces at play<br>
                If you hadn’t a toyed with and tempted the gods, every little step of the way</p>
 
    <p>your promises frequently died in their birth or unraveled like thread on a spool<br>
                And your favors all cost me more than their worth, and your help was at best miniscule<br>
                Cause you never so little as tried to be kind, and you never so much as succeeded<br>
                in the object of snubbing and robbing me blind, a hint would’ve been all that I needed<br>
                But who knows, despite all the reasons to go, I might’ve found the courage to stay<br>
                If you hadn’t accused me of moving too slow every little step of the way </p>
 
    <p>I have been called many things in my time, but a traveler’s what I mainly am<br>
                With nothing to tell of where I am bound, nor to say of where it was I began<br>
                When I come to a fork in the road, I pause; sometimes it’s just a second or two<br>
                Long enough to suppose that I am the sum of everything that I’ve been through<br>
                But the light’s never still where I stand alone, and I can afford no further delay<br>
                And I dream that I’m always arriving at home with every little step of the way     </p>

    <h2>Something Blue</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>So you say you’ve finally found the one you been awaiting all your life<br>
    And you say that now he’s asked for you to come and be his wife<br>
    And by the way you’re smiling now, I don’t suppose you told him, “No,”<br>
    I don’t suppose you said where he could go— </p>
 
    <p>And every bride within your family’s had some tradition to stick to<br>
    With something old, something brand-new, something borrowed, something blue<br>
    To wear or carry down the aisle to satisfy the trend<br>
    And you say you’d like my advice, just as your friend</p>
 
    <p>For something old you got that wedding dress your great-grandmother sewed<br>
                For something new, you got that wedding ring of 14 karat gold<br>
                For something borrowed you could take the torch I been holding out for you<br>
                And hell, invite me to your wedding, I’ll be your something blue</p>
 
    <p>I guess I should be happy that you found someone to love<br>
    Who, from the gutter of the world, knows that you’re outside and above<br>
    Who’s probably lived a lonesome life, looking high and low for you<br>
    Who, in so many words, can see you like I do </p>
 
    <p>And I guess I should feel relieved, rather than despised<br>
    To know I’m not the only one who can see what’s in your eyes<br>
    And to realize beyond any doubt, that there would have been no way<br>
    to be the one to say, “I do,” on your wedding day—</p>
 
    <p>for something old you got that memory of the two of us, alone<br>
                for something new you got that house I spose you’ll make into a home<br>
                for something borrowed you could take the heart I wore on my sleeve for you<br>
                and hell, invite me to your wedding—I’ll be your something blue</p>
 
    <p>it may be too late to tell you now what maybe never needed sayin<br>
    I may’ve missed the opportunity when you caught that outbound train<br>
    All I’ve got now to look forward to’s a lifetime of time to kill<br>
    because I loved you then, and now, and always will </p>
 
    <p>and I spose there must be moments, like the spokes on fortune’s wheel,<br>
    when the broken things within us will begin again to feel<br>
    when the broad daylight of morning will again seem warm and soft<br>
    but for me, that day’s still a long ways off</p>
 
    <p>for something old you got that story from the madame’s crystal ball<br>
                for something new you got a family and a portrait on your wall <br>
                for something borrowed you could take my dreams which have always been of you<br>
                and hell, invite me to your wedding, I’ll be your something blue    </p>

    <h2>Backslidin</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The woman takin care of me takes care to never let me be<br>
    You know I’d go home but she’ll just be standing there<br>
    In the porchlight with her rolling pin, she’ll cross her arms, say “Where you been?”<br>
    I’ll say “I can’t say,” and she’ll say, “No, you tell me where,”<br>
    I’ll say “I can’t say,” and she’ll just sigh and frown<br>
    And I’ll try to sleep just knowing she’s still standing there <br>
    Thinking how every time she trusts me I just go and let her down</p>
 
    <p>The time it sure has slipped by fast, my curfew’s come and gone and passed<br>
    And my money all got spent before my tab was paid<br>
    With another night of streets to roam and anywhere to go but home<br>
    I’ll begin to wonder of the impact my impression’s made<br>
    I’ll begin to wonder if I been lost or found<br>
    I’ll begin to wonder just how far off the path I’ve strayed<br>
    And if it’s likely I could make it back if I just stopped and turned around</p>
 
    <p>But now I’m frightened, more of myself than of the thunder or the lightening<br>
                More of the dawn than of the night that knows no brightening, lets me keep on hidin<br>
                I know my wrongs need rightening, and tho I know when it’s just bait well I’m still bitin<br>
                The more I wait the more I feel the noose a tightenin, and the stakes’re heightening</p>
                            And tho I hardly feel the slack and know I won’t fall through the crack
                            I’m hardly gone before I’m back—backslidin
 
    <p>The preacher asks me if I pray, I tell him each and every day<br>
    He asks me, “How?”—as if he really didn’t know<br>
    I tell him first I close my eyes then I just kind of wait to be surprised<br>
    “And does that work?” he always wants to know<br>
    “And does what work?” I say for my response<br>
    “Are your prayers answered—does God say ‘yes’ and ‘no’?”<br>
    I tell him: “Father, God does whatever the hell he damn well wants.”</p>
 
    <p>I try to keep the leash on tight, try to do what’s good and just and right<br>
    And it’s not too hard, so long as no one’s keepin score<br>
    But somehow midway down the line I find I’m cursed by my own design<br>
    And its no use explaining what I do things for<br>
    And its no use trying to use my words<br>
    Cause all I say is something someone’s said somewhere before<br>
    And comes out sounding just like nothing that I ain’t already heard</p>
 
    <p>But now I’m frightened—more of my self than any madness I’m ignitin<br>
                More of my heart than of my love that needs requitenin, that feels your spitenin<br>
                I know my wrongs need rightenin, and tho I’m running low on fuel, well I’m still ridin<br>
                And tho I’ve broken every rule I was abidenin, seems no one’s mindin</p>
                            And tho it used to be an act, I used to do it just for laughs
                            Seems now the whole charade is cracked and I’m just back—backslidin
 
    <p>My teacher taught me to be sick of science and arithmetic<br>
    “What good,” I asked, “is any of this stuff anyways?”<br>
    He warned me with a tired scold that “if you don’t do as you’re told<br>
    Well, you’ll find out for yourself one of these days—<br>
    And you’ll find out just how far you can get,”<br>
    And I found out right away because I cursed him to his face<br>
    And only lately have I thought of it as something I regret</p>
 
    <p>The officer of my parole, he says I’m under his control<br>
    And that if I even laugh too loud, well, he’ll be at my side<br>
    I can feel his eyes upon my skin, I’d shut them out but they lock me in<br>
    They say, “You’re lucky,” but that ain’t quite been verified<br>
    They say, “You’re free again,” but that ain’t quite been proved<br>
    They had my story written out before I testified<br>
    And I was sentenced for I knew of what I’d even been accused</p>
 
    <p>And now I’m frightened, more of myself than any foe that I’ve been fightin<br>
                More of the truth than of the lies that they’ve been writing, they’re self-indicting<br>
                But my wrongs need rightening, and tho I know the fuse is close well I’m still firin<br>
                The gate that leads to my destruction’s ever-widenin, slowly closing in</p>
                            And tho I knew it for a fact when the cards were dealt the deck was stacked
                            I still went all in for a jack, and now I’m back—backslidin

    <p>You wake up in the morning and you’re still drunk from lastnight<br>
    There’s a tooth missin from your grin<br>
    You know you gotta get up but you can’t find the light<br>
    In fact you don’t even know whose bed you’re in<br>
                The woman beside you just whispered she loved you<br>
                Which you’re sure you must’ve misunderstood<br>
                All you need now’s a cold shower—a cold shower<br>
                A cold shower’ll do you good</p>
 
    <p>It’s the middle of summer and it’s a thousand degrees<br>
    There’s steam risin up from the street<br>
    The air conditioner’s broken and the icebox won’t freeze<br>
    There’s no place for you to get out of the heat<br>
                You race to the pool but you can’t get in it’s full<br>
                Of every person in your neighborhood<br>
                All you need now’s a cold shower—a cold shower<br>
                A cold shower’ll do you good</p>
 
    <p>You’ve bought into everything and you think it’s all swell<br>
    living safely in your American dream<br>
    you’ve been breathing in foul air so long you can’t even smell<br>
    you’ve never drawn a single breath that’s clean<br>
                given the chance to upgrade and enhance, you <br>
                hesitate, wondering whether you should<br>
                all you need now’s a cold shower—a cold shower<br>

    <h2>I Think I'm Comin Down With Something Serious</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I came here by request to see my cousin whose been ill<br>
    Intending to remain but a week or so<br>
    My very first day here, I came down with a chill<br>
    That was nearly seven years ago</p>
 
    <p>They put me in a room where a man had just expired<br>
    Of some disease of which I’m sure I’d never heard<br>
    They told me all about how much he’d been admired <br>
    And how sad it was his condition could not be cured—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus- I think I’m coming down with something serious<br>
                            I don’t know how long it’ll be before I’m over this
                            I think I’m coming down with something serious
                            I don’t know if I’ll be getting up again
 
    <p>I’m sweating like a pig but I could use another sheet<br>
    My temperatures somewhere around 103<br>
    This morning I woke up and then I fell right back to sleep<br>
    When I opened up my eyes I could not see</p>
 
    <p>There’s a man here with a cough so bad he cannot talk<br>
    Just hacks and wipes his blood off in his sleeve<br>
    I asked the nurse, “How long before I get to see the doc?”<br>
    she pointed at him and said, “That’s the man you want to see,”</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Today I got a call from my boss back down below<br>
    He said I was due back at work—or else!<br>
    But I worked all my life, and what have I got to show?<br>
    As of now, I haven’t even got my health</p>
 
    <p>They put me on a cart and wheeled me to a room<br>
    where they strapped me to an old X-ray machine<br>
    everyone agreed that something must be done—and soon!<br>
    but they never told me what any of it means<br>
                chorus</p>
 
    <p>There’s a girl here from Duluth, she cannot speak a word<br>
    She communicates through shapes made with her hands<br>
    Whenever she’s around, I feel a pounding in my nerves<br>
    I get dizzy, weak, and cannot seem to stand—</p>
 
    <p>They listened to my heart, they opened up my veins<br>
    They looked inside my blood for some kind of sign<br>
    The nurse reported back that my heartbeat was just the rain<br>
    And it turns out my own blood ain’t even mine—</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Yesterday I wrote a letter out on the lawn<br>
    “Dear Uncle,” it said, “Sorry I misspoke.<br>
    If you reading these words now, it means that I am gone<br>
    And no, I don’t mean, stepped out for a smoke.</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been the child of privilege, known prosperity and wealth;<br>
    Please take my things and give them to the poor.<br>
    If you’d like to keep my books, please—go, and help yourself<br>
    Where I’m going—I won’t need them anymore”</p>

    <h2>Storm Beyond the Calm</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Wet Match, 2019</i> Track 9</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I had a girl I loved her madly; towards me her feeling was lukewarm<br>
    Later on I learned she had me in the calm before the storm<br>
    I thought that love would last forever, but I could not have been more wrong<br>
    You can’t dress for the weather in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>I aint been here in a long time, tho I guess not much has changed<br>
    There’s still a beauty in the lightning, there’s still a comfort in the rain<br>
    They say the night is always darkest the hour before the dawn<br>
    And love stands at its starkest in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>I tried livin in the city, but I couldn’t find a friend<br>
    So I moved into the country, started talking to the wind<br>
    Now I toil in my pasture, and I sleep out on the lawn<br>
    And I feel right at home here, in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>I been up and down the mountain, I trudged through the desert dunes<br>
    I drank from pleasure’s fountains, and howled at bluer moons<br>
    But there’s no gold in el dorado, and in gilead’s no balm<br>
    You’re stuck waiting for tomorrow in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>And there’s no one to write home to from freedom’s giant cage<br>
    Everyone that claims to know you just turns your anger into praise<br>
    Goliath wants a rematch, but David’s busy with his psalms<br>
    Words are useful as a wet match in the storm beyond the calm</p>
 
    <p>So I guess I’ll keep a goin down the road that’s got me lost<br>
    Leaning gainst the breezes blowin, weighing the spoils against the cost<br>
    I tried admitting I was weak once, but I’ve never been that strong</p>
                                                                In the storm beyond the calm
 
    <p>I been out on a short limb when the branches have been sawn<br>
    I brushed against the heavens seen the gorges neath me yawn<br>
    Death can grin to hear my laughter, but I’ll sing another song<br>
    And survive one more disaster in the storm beyond the calm    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#wetMatch_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Just a traveler—on a road<br>
    Making good time; making head-way to nowhere at all<br>
    Left my footprints—where it snowed<br>
    That’s as good as any farewell letter I could scrawl<br>
                I mouthed the words I could not say—as tho I thought I could undo <br>
                The choice to stand and stay remains—tho it is I who have now forsaken you<br>
    An empty feelin burns me through—I can’t waiver<br>
    I can’t linger in this moment anymore<br>
    With midnight stealing into blue—my whole horizon<br>
    Is disappearing in a sudden blur<br>
                I rapped upon the frosted glass—wherein my gaunt reflection shone<br>
                When I climbed in the cabbie asked—“Where have you been, </p>
                                                                                                    but first, tell me where you goin?” 
    <p>CHORUS: I wanna go home—home—<br>
                                        Home—that’s where I wanna go 
 
    <p>Breakfast table—a broken plate, mama’s bathrobe<br>
    Dragging dirty round her ankles on the floor<br>
    A stream of boxcars hauling freight, and November<br>
    coming early and unwelcome through the door<br>
                I woke up inside a bus that had carved all night to make it through a storm<br>
                I’s just in time to see the fog rise up from out of the Pennsylvania corn <br>
    No tomorrows—in this town<br>
    Just a motel with its neon flashing “Vacant” in the cold<br>
    must be shrinking—these things down <br>
    in my memory, either that or else I’m just getting old<br>
                I found a sign that read “free meal” and pressed upon a door to see<br>
                I nearly cried when the waitress come and asked me: Son, what’ll it be? </p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>I been to Nashville, outer space, Oklahoma<br>
    Now I’m sitting in my Philadelphia room<br>
    Trying to read things I’ve erased, or written over<br>
    Or told myself I’d reckon pretty soon—<br>
                Barring not that I should fail, still I—have struggled to resist<br>
                the thought that where I’m trying to land may well not even exist<br>
    Life’s a strange sort of museum—full of routines<br>
    Full of desperate efforts catapulting loss <br>
    So many visions—you can’t believe em—til its too late<br>
    Til your faith wears the same odor as exhaust<br>
                I clicked my heels three times and prayed—to a God I could not see<br>
                I stamped and addressed myself so the postman would know exactly where to deliver me</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>Just a traveler on a road making good time; making headway to nowhere at all<br>

    <h2>Since You Left (Ain't Nothin Been the Same)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The water tastes like metal and the coffee tastes like paint<br>
    And everything I eat these days makes me want to faint<br>
    I went to see my doctor and I told him my complaint<br>
    He said it ain’t your tongue that’s broken, it’s your brains—<br>
                It gives me cause to wonder, or should I say, to doubt<br>
                Whether its even blood that’s flowin in my veins<br>
                Everything was goin one way now it goes a different route<br>
                And since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>The colors on my pallet have all gone and changed their hue<br>
    My yellows ain’t so yellow and my blues are darker blue<br>
    The poetry inside my books just doesn’t ring as true<br>
    Each familiar thing now strikes me as strange<br>
                Everywhere the sun is shining but a clouds formed over me<br>
                And I moved here just to get out of the rain<br>
                I don’t know if it’s a secret plot or some conspiracy<br>
                But since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>The windshield’s got a crack now and the front door’s got a creak<br>
    The lamp it has a busted bulb and the faucet’s sprung a leak<br>
    And my entire outlook onto life’s grown pretty bleak<br>
    I spent my mornings watching things go down the drain<br>
                I don’t know if it’s coincidence, bad luck or even fate<br>
                Tho I’m afraid I’m hardly able to explain<br>
                The smallest shred of sense I can’t configure or create<br>
                But since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>Rivers used to lead to oceans, now they flow right to their source<br>
    Birds used to fly south in the winter, now they’re headin north<br>
    Time, she walked a tightrope, now she’s swining back and forth<br>
    No sand inside the hourglass remains<br>
                I’m still fighting the old demons, the Mondays and the blues<br>
                Tho the upper hand I no longer seem to gain<br>
                All the things I once relied on now reject me or refuse<br>
                And since you left ain’t nothing been the same</p>
 
    <p>My feet, they roam the ceiling, and my head, it scrapes the floor<br>
    Today I tried to go outside but I coulnd’t reach the door<br>
    I don’t think the laws of gravity are workin anymore<br>
    What goes down once can still go down again<br>
                But don’t worry bout me darling I think I’m starting to get well<br>
                I’m sure that someday it’ll all be plain<br>
                You came to me so gently that the change was hard to tell<br>
                But since you left ain’t nothing been the same<br>
    I’m easily distracted, my mind is all off track<br>
    I still think of you from time to time, wonder if you’re comin back<br>
    I left a candle burning and a key under the mat<br>
    With a note on which I didn’t put your name<br>
                If you come acallin for me and I don’t answer right away<br>
                It ain’t because I’m angry or detained<br>
                Probably I’m just trine to think of something new to say<br>
                Cause since you left ain’t nothing been the same    </p>

    <h2>Hell of a Day I'm Havin</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Woke up this morning to a rooster crowing<br>
    The sails were set but the wind wasn’t blowing<br>
    It was the middle of june and it was already snowing<br>
    I should’ve known something was wrong</p>
 
    <p>Rolled out of be put my shirt on backwards<br>
    Pulled my pants on first and my underwear aftwards<br>
    Slipped on the stairs made a whole in the plaster<br>
    Right where your portrait belonged</p>
 
    <p>Went down to the kitchen to make a pot of coffee<br>
    I poured it, stirred it, then spilled it on me<br>
    Went to make it again but the can was empty<br>
    All I could do was scowl</p>
 
    <p>It seems like I can’t do anything right<br>
                I go to bed early lay awake all night<br>
                I’m afflicted by forces that I just can’t fight<br>
                Might as well throw in the towel</p>
 
                            But what a hell of a day I’m havin     
                            If this is some kinda joke, man, I ain’t laughin
                            I know worse things have been known to happen
                            But they ain’t been known to happen to me
 
    <p>Drivin to work my front wheel exploded<br>
    It seems the tire pressure had been overloaded<br>
    That the fault was mine has been duly noted<br>
    The tow-man told me so</p>
 
    <p>Got into the office a little behind schedule<br>
    My boss thought my tardiness was intentional<br>
    Said the time’s come for me to do what’s sensible<br>
    Gave me the old heave-ho</p>
 
    <p>Got home early met my girlfriend leavin<br>
    Said she didn’t have time to go into the reasons<br>
    Said that there was something else that she was needin<br>
    I said “What about me?” she said, “No—”</p>
 
    <p>And it feels like I can’t keep anything straight<br>
                I pay up-front face-value at the goin-rate<br>
                But its always just a little too little too late<br>
                Either too fast or much too slow</p>
                            Chorus
 
    <p>Preachers and teachers, they taunt and test me<br>
    The neighbors complain and the cops arrest me<br>
    And every person I’ve ever loved has left me<br>
    What’s that supposed to say about me?</p>
 
    <p>I was disinvited to a colleague’s wedding<br>
    It seems I couldn’t prevent an ugly rumor from spreading<br>
    I receieved a memorandum with the following heading<br>
    You and me, pistols at dawn</p>
 
    <p>I showed up late but I brought my seconds<br>
    We shook hands quickly and chose our weapons <br>
    Threw up a coin and it just went on flippin<br>
    Til all our hard feelings was gone</p>
 
    <p>Seems like I can’t follow anything thru<br>
                I wake up from a nightmare and it just comes true<br>
                Meanwhile everything beautiful reminds me of you<br>
                Like a star I keep wishin on</p>
 
                            Chorus
 
    <p>New York Times said the end was nearing<br>
    Paper hit my porch as the smoke was clearing<br>
    I’s trine to decide if the sound I’s hearing<br>
    Was in or outside of my head</p>
 
    <p>Sun came out around eleven thirty<br>
    I tried to see through the flames but my glasses were dirty<br>
    I cried out for help but nobody heard me<br>
    They probably all thought I was dead</p>
 
    <p>I dragged myself out of the smoldering rubble<br>
    Out of the frying pan headed for trouble<br>
    Spent my life on the sea, just to drown in a puddle<br>
    I swear you couldn’t make this stuff up</p>
 
    <p>I just can’t make up my lost mind it seems<br>
                Whether I’m goin or coming apart at the seems<br>
                I might be a ghost you know that all that it means<br>
                Is that I just can’t let go</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>

    <h2>The Whereabouts of His Forgotten Mistress</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>So you’ve finally made your peace with those you used to go ahead and make your wars with<br>
    I knew you had it in you babe to lay down your sword upon the shield you prayed and swore with<br>
    Tell me, can you name the thing it was that made you want to go and change your old ways for forever?<br>
    Were you makin adjustments just now when you saw me, or were you just trine to prove that you were clever?</p>
 
    <p>Last we met as I recall you inquired of the whereabouts of your old lover<br>
    A man they called by many names and titles that changed as he roamed from one town into another<br>
    Your man I know I met one night though I admit it only was in passin<br>
    I asked him straight up who he was and like you said he would, he asked me who was askin</p>
 
    <p>I said to take his pick of names, he could call me what he liked for all it mattered<br>
    He gestured to a curtain near a window the behind of which a mirror had been shattered<br>
    We were in the this hotel bar and seemed the only travelers there who needed restin<br>
    I could tell he crawled a thousand miles by his feeble face and the beggars rags he dressed in </p>
 
    <p>For a time we spoke of nothing and only said the things that never needed sayin<br>
    Of how he never meant to leave but had to get back to fleein from the debts that needed payin<br>
    He said he sposed you’d sent me to find out what became of that widowed heart’s disaster<br>
    He said a thing to say to you I couldn’t hear over the thunder’s raging laughter</p>
 
    <p>So now I’ve circled back to you, you know that you’re as hard to find as he is<br>
    I tried to trace the love you lost and all I got for clues are my own ideas<br>
    But what I still can’t figure out is why you want so bad to know he’s out of rations<br>
    As if to know he’d settled down and were fine somewhere were the worst thing you could imagine</p>
 
    <p>I’ve crossed the deserts wild and come within an inch of the maw of the volcano<br>
    I’ve poured the legends tall and drunk them deep and know as well they never stay the same though<br>
    Been up and down and lost and found and run around back and forth all across the country<br>
    I’ve consumed what’s been presumed to be too much, stood up and still been hungry</p>
 
    <p>Now I don’t mean to speak for you, for who am I but a lowly bounty hunter<br>
    I’ve been paid to make my way and find out what I can by the contract that I’m under<br>
    But if you could within your heart try to make a place that wasn’t such a prison<br>
    Perhaps you’d have no need of me and we could both of us just get back to livin    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>How’m I supposed to know that you’re angry?<br>
    How’m I supposed to know you’re unhappy?<br>
    How’m I supposed to know that it ain’t my fault?</p>
 
    <p>You’ve spoken your piece and look, you’ve gone silent<br>
    Put down your fists, no need to get violent<br>
    You opened the wound, and now you’re just adding salt<br>
    Til the whole conversation’s been ground to a screeching halt</p>
 
    <p>Honestly—<br>
                I can’t see—<br>
                how you ever got to be—so like a rock<br>
                That short of a contract deal—<br>
                that don’t make anything anymore real—<br>
                somehow you still feel—</p>
                                                    You can’t even talk—to me
 
    <p>You’re never around on the evenings or weekends<br>
    Your secrets unfold as your mystery deepens <br>
    the crease of your letter was known to be uncommonly sharp</p>
 
    <p>I’m past any hope or cry of remembering<br>
    like a ripening tear in the duct, you’ve been trembling<br>
    but tell me again, and forgive me—I’m still in the dark<br>
    I can see now what Time will do, yes, it’s left its mark </p>
 
    <p>& I’ve been briefed<br>
                Not to turn over a new leaf<br>
                Cause it won’t bring no release—to a way that’s been blocked<br>
                But can’t you understand<br>
                It’ll be out of my hands<br>
                How you gonna make any new demands</p>
                                                    If you don’t talk—to me?
 
    <p>I tiptoed around and I bent over backwards<br>
    Walking on eggshells, I examined your hazards<br>
    Raking your bed of coals just brought me to thin ice— </p>
 
    <p>So take all the time in the world that you’re needing<br>
    I’ll be alright, it’s not like I’m bleeding<br>
    Go and be a good to yourself for once in your life<br>
    You don’t need my permission, you don’t even gotta think twice<br>
                I’ve been advised<br>
                Not to apologize<br>
                Tho I don’t think it’s wise—and frankly I’m shocked<br>
                That that could be so clear<br>
                To someone who ain’t right here<br>
                Who don’t know the fear—that you’ve apparently got<br>
                And I don’t want to pry<br>
                I don’t want to be “that guy”<br>
                Cause I know you’re shy—and I guess I’m not<br>
                But I’m on my knees<br>
                It’s my only need<br>
                Please, please, please—won’t you talk—to me?     </p>

    <h2>It's You (You're Grieving Now)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Time passes so slow when you’re trying to rise—and you’re sinkin<br>
    You wish you were moving on, but you got nowhere to be—and you’re thinking<br>
    You grieved with everything you had<br>
    Every beat of heart you could allow—<br>
    But even doing it all for him<br>
    In the end still wasn’t enough somehow—</p>
                            cause it’s you—
                            It’s you—                                                                    —you’re grievin now
 
    <p>The record’s stuck in the groove, repeating a phrase—and you let it<br>
    The young man is making his move, he gives you his word—you forget it<br>
                You’re still hung up on a choice you made<br>
                That you’d’ve undone if time had allowed<br>
                But even if he were here<br>
                Don’t you think he’d be able to point it out: </p>
                            That its you—
                            Its you—you’re grieving now
 
    <p>The faucet’s screwed to the sink, it ain’t going noplace—but its drippin<br>
    The rope’s tied fast to the weight swinging high overhead—but it’s slippin<br>
                You know you shouldn’t feel bad<br>
                And you tell yourself like you was making a vow<br>
                Your sorrow’s the size of your love for him<br>
                Just like you always knew it was, somehow</p>
                            But it’s you—
                            It’s you—you’re grieving now
 
    <p>Once you’d do anything to relieve all the pain—you were feeling<br>
    But now you can’t bear to think that numb’s all you are—and you’re healing  <br>
                 Perhaps there’s been some mistake<br>
                It’s all been an act, and here comes the bow—<br>
                The dead will exit the stage<br>
                Leaving the audience better off somehow</p>
                            But it’s you—
                            It’s you—you’re grieving now

    <h2>Losing You</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>It’s been a while now since the last time we talked<br>
    But I been tracing your footsteps in the paths that we walked<br>
    And I been kicking myself cause opportunity knocked—<br>
                And I didn’t know that it was my cue</p>
 
    <p>And I’m remembering things that I shouldn’t’ve said<br>
    Thinking bout what I could’ve told you instead<br>
    It makes me wish sometimes that I were actually dead<br>
                Rather than merely regretful and blue</p>
 
    <p>The cracks of my fingers the rain’s fallin through<br>
                What is it exactly you want me to do?<br>
                Maybe I’m losing my sane point of view</p>
                            But it feels like—I don’t know
                            It feels like—I don’t know
                            It feels like I’m losing you—
                            It feels like I’m losing you
 
    <p>you changed all your habits to suit your new friends<br>
    To whom you were never more than a means to an end<br>
    You’re much further gone than even you can pretend<br>
                Yet you make believe none of it’s new </p>
 
    <p>And you stand by and watch as your handiwork spoils:<br>
    As your patience expires and your temperature boils<br>
    and from your tenderest gesture the medusa recoils<br>
                as if to say it already knew</p>
 
    <p>I’ve examined the floorplan the architect drew<br>
                Seems its somekind of labyrinth we’ve been wandering through<br>
                And maybe I’ve lost the thread that this needle went to</p>
                            but it feels like—I don’t know 
                            it feels like—I don’t know
                            it feels like I’m losing you 
 
    <p>you take on too much, you’re like a martyr at dusk<br>
    the things that you once believed in you no longer trust<br>
    the machinery to help you has taken on rust<br>
                and you’ve bitten off more than you can chew</p>
 
    <p>But when I saw you this morning—you seemed in a good place<br>
    You had a spring in your step and a smile on your face<br>
    I thought you’d be shipwrecked but it wasn’t the case<br>
                I wondered just what had come over you?</p>
 
    <p>this war has been raging too long now, it’s true<br>
                what was my little big horn was your waterloo  <br>
                sure, maybe I won me a battle or two<br>
                but it feels like—I don’t know<br>
                it feels like—I don’t know<br>
                it feels like I’m losing you<br>
                it feels like I’m losing you     </p>

    <p>Got no money in the bank; got no gas inside my tank<br>
    I’ve only got myself to thank that I’ve got nothing left to lose<br>
    But even if I owned a stitch, somehow got lucky, struck it rich<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>The doctor he reviewed my chart, the nurse she listened to my heart<br>
    They asked me bout my history and then both of them withdrew<br>
    I’m told that they’re comparing notes, but I still ain’t been diagnosed<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>The judge he made the jury rise, recite the verdict, improvise<br>
    It came as no surprise to me that nobody had a clue<br>
    The prosecution made a move for what nobody had to prove<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>King Solomon he did command that every person in the land<br>
    Should be rounded up and counted with the riches he’d accrued<br>
    When he’d totaled all that he owned, he just hung his head and moaned:<br>
    Lord knows, I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>There came a crying from the earth, there was a death, there was a birth<br>
    I neither could determine nor decide just what was true<br>
    The only thing I know for sure, hatred dies, love endures<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>When in trouble hope for change, if in doubt pray for rain<br>
    When in Rome, the tourists say, do as the Romans do<br>
    But if you won’t give me this dance, please allow me just one more chance<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you<br>
    Lord knows I ain’t got much if I ain’t got you</p>
 
    <p>Bridges: You’re the only thing that keeps me on the even keel<br>
                            Who tells it like it is when it just don’t seem for real
                            You’re the bridge over the highway of a life that I ain’t crossed
                            Without you I am no one, I am nowhere, I am lost
    <p>You’re the reason anything in this crazy world makes sense<br>
                            Without you life’s a catalogue of random accidents
                            Causes that have nothing t’all to do with their effects
                            Dots scattered in a universe that no one else connects

    <h2>Keepin Busy</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Friday night, my baby came home just as tired as could be<br>
    I asked her how her day was she said she didn’t want to talk to me<br>
    I said how come and she got mad, said cause she was all worn out<br>
    And she comes home to find me here sleeping on the couch</p>
 
    <p>I said, Baby, Darlin—you know I ain’t been here all day<br>
    I been busy too you know while you have been away<br>
    “Oh really?” she said, “Is that so? Well in that case I’d love to hear<br>
    Just all about the things you did while I wasn’t here”</p>
 
    <p>I did the laundry, the dishes, I filed the taxes / sent out my resume with necessary attachments<br>
    I swept, scraped and mopped the floor / fixed the old hinge on that creaky cellar door<br>
    I sent a get well card to your ailing brother, I called and spoke with your ex-step-mother<br>
    She said to tell you she’s doin fine, I told her you’d give her a call sometime<br>
    I raked the leaves, cleaned out the gutters, painted the door-frames and the window-shutters  <br>
    I filled out applications for a half-dozen jobs, groomed the cat and walked the dog<br>
    I borrowed a mower from the next door neighbor / cut the grass in our yard and in his, as a favor<br>
    I cleaned the garage, the attic, the basement / retarred the driveway with quality pavement<br>
    I got the kids up, dressed em, made em breakfast / took one to the doctor, one to the dentist<br>
    I made their lunches, and gottem to school, picked em up and took em to the swimming pool<br>
    I made a list and went grocery shopping, ran seven miles without even stopping<br>
    Somewhere in there, I pulled a muscle, did a whole Sunday Times crossword puzzle <br>
    I entertained visitors, gave em a tour, I found that lost earring you been looking for<br>
    I took out the garbage, brought in the mail, I sold a lot of your junk at a neighbor’s yardsale <br>
    I hung your portraits after getting them framed, I organized the spice rack alphabetically by name<br>
    I vacuumed and dusted every room and surface, gave every useless trinket a purpose<br>
    I found what was wrong with the garbage disposal, I proof-read and edited your meeting proposal<br>
    I cooked your favorite meal: vegetable lasagna, set the table and then waited on ya<br>
    I went to the post office and then to the bank, went to the gas station, filled up the tank <br>
    Then I came back home and cracked open a beer, and that’s the whole story of how I got here<br>
                And look, I know it don’t look like I done too much, and I haven’t, don’t get me wrong—<br>
                But I been keepin busy, trine to keep from goin crazy—<br>
                Yes, I been keepin busy, since you been gone </p>
 
    <p>But it was no use, all my explanations, they were to no avail<br>
    Time after time, again and again it seems no matter what I do, I fail<br>
    She said she was very sorry, but she didn’t see us working out<br>
    And just like that she showed me the door and said, “Alright now, get out!”</p>
 
    <p>For a while I was miserable, I couldn’t seem to catch a break<br>
    I didn’t know how much worse it could get, or how much more I could take<br>
    Then one day she called me up, said it had been too long a time<br>
    When she asked me how I was doin, I told her I was just fine</p>
 
    <p>I invented my very own dietary supplement, I took up yoga, achieved enlightenment,<br>
    I burned all those letters that I never sent you, finally read all those books I meant to,   <br>
    I got membership cards to every local library, I memorized the Oxford English Dictionary<br>
    I rented every movie at the video store, watched em all twice, some three times, some four<br>
    I joined a gym, lost a few-dozen pounds, believe me it was a lot harder than it sounds, <br>
    I rode my bike all across the country, saw how folks was living in the 21st century<br>
    I worked some farms and at a couple of factories, water treatment plants, fishing hatcheries<br>
    I grew my hair out, then shaved it short—let’s see what else is there to report <br>
    I learned to count cards, took up gambling, traveled all over, roaming and rambling<br>
    I started a business with the money I won, then sold it to invest in another one<br>
    I went back to school got my degrees, my bachelor’s, master’s and a phD<br>
    I was nominated for a couple awards for accomplishing the things I’d put my mind towards <br>
    I finally learned how to cook and to bake, there’s practically nothing now that I can’t make<br>
    I apologized to every person I’d wronged, finished my memoire, wrote a few songs<br>
    I penned several drafts of my last testament will, Lord knows I’ve sure had some time to kill <br>
                But say how are you doing with your new life? Looks like you’ve merrily been getting along<br>
                Yes, well I been keepin busy, trine to keep from going crazy<br>
                Yes I just been keepin busy since you been gone    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Since You Been Gone, 2020</i> Track 9</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sinceYouBeenGone_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Now I am a taker in this hard-up world, the fortune-teller told me first<br>
    She proved it to me when I took her word for every penny it was worth <br>
    to this day I still can’t say how it all first came to her so clear<br>
                when way back then I was on my way—to anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>I’s born a long ways from my home, but I been bound there ever since<br>
    And I’s made to walk the road alone, in fact, I’ve leapt at every chance<br>
    I’ve lost count of both my friends and foes, I can’t keep track of every fallen tear<br>
                Good and bad, they come and go—they’re with you anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>some folks they live in stacks of brick, some in cities of cement<br>
    for a long time I was most at home whichever way the railroad went<br>
    and every time that station whistle’d call, the sound was music to my ear<br>
                the trains they come from no place at all, bound for anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>It was easy going for a while, I’d say—that is, until the road got rough<br>
    And I earned my money in a honest way, until I didn’t have enough<br>
    When the time was ripe to make a break, my engine stalled in second gear<br>
                I might’ve settled for a simpler fate, one that put me anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>well I found myself in some trucker bar where the beer was pretty cheap<br>
    I drank my fill and went to pay and learned my purse was not so deep<br>
    They took what I owed them out of my flesh and threw me out upon my ear<br>
                Said I was welcome back anytime—that is, anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>I always dreampt I’d wind up some place, where all there’d be is time to kill<br>
    But where I’m from dreams get replaced by working dayshift at the mill<br>
    And the work is hard, and when you’re through, you look back on your career<br>
                The old men say it’s all okay—somewhere, anywhere but here</p>
 
    <p>I swear there’s nothing I got left in store, I won’t hand you no excuse<br>
    Please just don’t hit me anymore, I can’t take no more abuse<br>
    yesterday’s is too far gone, and tomorrow’s never near<br>
                you can’t never change the road you’re on—when you’re not anywhere but here </p>
 
    <p>I’s never much of a praying man, the Lord I’d never cause to fear<br>
    But if you’re somewhere up there, Old Man, here’s one prayer I hope you hear<br>
    If I go gently in the night, or hard, falling down upon my spear<br>
                lord, when I die, please just see that I—wind up anywhere but here    </p>

    <p>How you gonna stand there and act like it don’t matter<br>
    When with every passin second here, I’m just getting sadder?<br>
                You don’t owe me anything, your debt’s as good as paid<br>
                You don’t gotta follow through on any of the plans you made<br>
                You can come out from your hiding place, pick up the traps you’ve laid</p>
                            Everywhere throughout these fields of clover
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and tell me you still love me<br>
    When all the while you just been holding sharp and heavy things above me?<br>
                You can take down your battleflag, saddle up your mule<br>
                Put your needle in the cactusplant, and the thread back on the spool<br>
                You don’t have to be afraid now, baby, you can play it cool</p>
                            Resume your role as the ice queen of October
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and ask me now for money<br>
    And say, what are you laughin for, do you think that this is funny?<br>
                You said you’d always be there for me anytime no matter what<br>
                You said you’d come and save me if I needed you to, but<br>
                I can see that what was in your heart’s just moved into your gut</p>
                            You don’t have to get clean for me, or sober
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and pretend you didn’t do it<br>
    When you had it comin to me the whole time and you knew it         <br>
                I don’t have expectations anymore ever since I’ve gotten wise<br>
                To your elaborate deceptions which you so cleverly disguise<br>
                You think you’re seein clearly but you got wool over your eyes</p>
                            You needn’t look to see what’s just behind your shoulder
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and say things’ll all be different<br>
    When you don’t have the heart to say it ain’t good when it isn’t?<br>
                I’m no longer keeping promises—it’s never done me any good<br>
                All that being honest’s shown me is that I’ve never understood<br>
                I did it all correctly but my reputation’s in the mud</p>
                            I’m not making anymore unwarranted disclosures
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and make like you’re the victim?<br>
    When you went out looking for a fight, you found em and you picked em?<br>
                Considering the circumstance, it’s a wonder you don’t feel<br>
                A little more responsible for your part in the deal<br>
                The water flows beneath the bridge, and fortune turns her wheel</p>
                            I’m not getting any younger here, only older
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and just tell me to forget it?<br>
    When it’ll turn into the end of the whole world if you let it?<br>
                The credits here are rolling everybody’s free to leave<br>
                You played the game by all the rules and you got your reprieve<br>
                You outghtta be more cheerful you got no reason to greive</p>
                            You don’t have to stand there stone-faced like a soldier
                                        Now—that it’s over
 
    <p>How you gonna stand there and say this ain’t the ending?<br>
    Do you mean to say that all along this time you were pretending?<br>
                I’d prefer it if you didn’t drag this out into a scene<br>
                You don’t have to clarify, we both know what you mean<br>
                You can take what’s left of what you own, there’s nothing else to clean</p>
                            You can leave the coals inside the stove to smolder
                                        Now—that it’s over

    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Midnight on the boulevard, you know that I been looking hard<br>
    For someplace I can rest my bones<br>
    The dumpster’s growing tentacles and the alley’s drawing animals <br>
    And my shoes are filling up with stones<br>
    headlights all around me flash and splash and try drown me<br>
    as invisibly I make my way<br>
    billboards, with their promises of futures bleak and ominous<br>
    saying everything’s gonna be okay<br>
    there’s holy men in beggar’s clothes, schoolgirls in their pantyhose<br>
    policemen dressing for the raid<br>
    anyplace I sit or stand I’m in the way of the marchingband<br>
    or some exclusive VIP parade<br>
    Got a ticket to ride the rocket putting a hole right through my pocket <br>
    They say they’ve got her loaded, gassed and primed<br>
    With nothing else to recommend, and no regards to leave or send <br>
    I think I’ll go and get in line<br>
    If tomorrow I just disappeared,<br>
                I’m not sure that I’d be missed                       <br>
    The answer’s not a part of me<br>
    I only know there’s gotta be more to life than this</p>
 
    <p>The sheriff and his band of droogs is out tonight in one of their moods<br>
    They say they’re looking for the saboteurs<br>
    Nobody seems to know a thing, and as for the fellas in the ring<br>
    They’s just settling up old scores<br>
    Diamond Joe and his brother Ace spoke of meeting up someplace<br>
    As an act of service to their queen<br>
    They’d been assigned a mission that may have required demolition<br>
    By now they’re probably blown to smithereens<br>
    There’s blood smeared on the mantlepiece of every house on Market St<br>
    I’ve heard it’s precautionary for the plague<br>
    But as for how it’s sposed to help, you gotta figure that one out yourself<br>
    The instructions left were pretty vague<br>
    You can follow the road to nowhere or you can take it from one who’s been there<br>
    who drank the kool-aid from the source<br>
    haul in your anchor, hoist your sails, don’t look back, if all else fails<br>
    shout for “Mercy!” til your voice goes hoarse<br>
    If tomorrow were all I had<br>
                I’d blow it one last lover’s kiss<br>
                I’m not one to act modestly<br>
                I only know there’s gotta be more to life than this— </p>
 
    <p>I got here around six o’clock, the breadlines already down the block<br>
    The hopeless ones have placed their bets<br>
    The early birds have all skipped town, the ones a little bit further down<br>
    don’t even know what they’re in line to get<br>
    The grocer’s peddling contraband with a stick of dynamite in his hand<br>
    He’s always asking for the time<br>
    We’ve been through the whole thing twice, but even if he lowered the price<br>
    Could anybody spare a dime?<br>
    Patience is a virtue, too much of anything will hurt you<br>
    Therefore—whatever’s a man to do?<br>
    I’m just waiting on my payday, but even so it’s only Monday<br>
    And I need something to look forward to<br>
    Disguised as one of my former selves, I followed the casino bells<br>
    dealer told me fate was mine to choose<br>
    I had the king, the ace, the ten, but I told him to go and hit me again<br>
    Cause I only ever play to lose<br>
                If tomorrow I struck it rich<br>
                I’m not sure I’d feel bliss<br>
                Accustomed to my poverty <br>
                I only know there’s gotta be more to life than this</p>
 
    <p>You can take pill to get out of bed, another one’ll clear your head<br>
    A third will get you out the door<br>
    I once had a prescription that fit precisely that description <br>
    If you need some, I can get some more—<br>
    There’s a drink to keep you awake all day, another to take the pain away<br>
    And another yet to help you get it back<br>
    There’s a problem solved by every drug, but as for never knowing love<br>
    I don’t know if I can help with that—<br>
    The doctor’s out, he called in sick, took something he thought would do the trick<br>
    But that was way back in july<br>
    His secretary says she’s his friend, but I’ve heard her tell a few since then<br>
    he’s just been waiting around to die <br>
    Left alone with his memories, transfixed in his reveries<br>
    The prisoner, in his cell, stands tall<br>
    Reflects upon coincidence, weighs the price of innocence<br>
    And adds another tally to his wall<br>
                If tomorrow, I walked out of here<br>
                I’d be happy just to exist<br>
                Meanwhile there’s a lotta me <br>
                That only knows there’s gotta be more to life than this</p>
 
    <p>feeling like a change of scene, I moved into a submarine<br>
    I tried to write you though I was feeling full<br>
    The envelopes, still unaddressed, accumulated in a chest<br>
    That I ejected through the torpedo hole<br>
    someday when I’m dust and ash, they may wash up like so much trash<br>
    decorations for some pristine beach<br>
    To whomsoever findeth these, I send sincere apologies <br>
    I’m still out here, somewhere, out of reach<br>
    With nothing but my strength of will, my boulder and my stretch of hill<br>
    I once more for the thousandth time<br>
    Set my weight against the rock, imagine, but don’t check the clock<br>
    And gradually begin to climb<br>
    In the event I plummet sometime before I reach the summit<br>
    I hardly think it’s worth a frown<br>
    When you’ve only ever had it bad, the only thing that’ll make you glad<br>
    Is seeing the weight you dragged up roll back down<br>
    If tomorrow I wake up dead<br>
                I’d not protest, but I’d still wish—<br>
                that someone had only thought of me<br>
                reminded me that there’s gotta be more to life than this     </p>

    <p>Foreman says its back to work, wants to see us live and movin<br>
    It’s no secret tho that he’s a jerk and this job it ain’t my choosin<br>
    It’s nine to nine on the ssembly line ain’t exactly that amusing<br>
    And we’ll probably all get us overtime, but that’s the weekend that we’re losin<br>
                Now I ain’t a one to make complaints, even when pushin comes to shoving<br>
                But I wished I had me another day for to sit round doing nothing</p>
 
    <p>On my one day off I slept in late didn’t get up until the evening<br>
    I cooked a meal, put it on a plate, but I couldn’t find the seasoning<br>
    So I drove my car to the grocery store, without forethought or reasoning<br>
    When I got there I found me a parking spot, steppin out I locked my keys in<br>
                For a minute I just stood there, all a red-faced and a cussin—<br>
                And I wished I had me another day for to sit round doing nothing</p>
 
    <p>In the summertime when the weather’s fine as well you may imagine<br>
    The sun it shines through my window-blinds where my eyelids are a-hatchin<br>
    Upon the beach I watch the sea where the waves come softly crashin<br>
    Against the crags beneath my seat where the mermaids are asplashin<br>
                Some days are meant for makin plans, and some days are for discussin<br>
                But me I tend to like the days where you can sit round doin nothing</p>
 
    <p>Out on the porch in my rocking chair with my pocket knife a whiddlin<br>
    Just enjoying nature’s outdoor air a hummin and a whistling<br>
    My sleeves are short and my feet are bare, I like to keep my toes a wigglin<br>
    When I run all out of wood to carve always got my thumbs for twiddling<br>
                No I don’t relate to people well, whether a stranger or my cousin<br>
                Folks always seem to want to do something else besides for nothing</p>
 
    <p>I had my eye on a pretty girl she was a one-in-a-twenty-million<br>
    I asked her for to marry me if she’d be so kind and willing<br>
    Well she didn’t say one word to me and just then something happened<br>
    She called a fella to come over here, and introduced me to her husband<br>
                He shook my hand so hard it hurt, and boy, was I a blushin<br>
                If I could’ve done it all again, I guess I would’ve never had said nothing</p>
 
    <p>When this life has gone and passed me by on my deathbed I’ll be dyin<br>
    And if I ain’t outlived the folks I know, haps around me they’ll be cryin<br>
    When the old man comes to reap my soul I won’t keep him long from tryin<br>
    I wouldn’t say that I’d be ready tho, if I did I would be lyin<br>
                My mind will rest from thinking sore and my heart will rest from lovin<br>
                But I’ll still wished I had me another day to sit round doing nothing    </p>

    <h2>A Brief Reflection Upon My Life to Date</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I am tired of trying to explain the reasons<br>
    For feelings I am powerless to understand<br>
    Sometimes I wish I could control the seasons<br>
                Or control my heartbeat<br>
                Or direct its yearning<br>
                That only something was not out of my hands<br>
    And I have been accused this way before by others<br>
    Like you I only wanted someone I could save<br>
    But if I am nothing but a coward now<br>
                And you may not believe this<br>
                And you do not have to<br>
                But it’s only because once I was much too brave</p>
                            For I have lived my life like a burning building
                            Like a rolling tide upon an ancient sea
                            And before I die, I only hope, God willing,
                            That I may learn what it is that I was meant to be
 
    <p>I have had my share of angry tantrums<br>
    The blazing furnace I have starved to cold<br>
    I gave myself where I wasn’t wanted <br>
                Revealed in earnest<br>
                What it was I needed<br>
                Took big chances<br>
                Hoped to get wise early but just got old<br>
    And I have steeled my heart for grave misfortune<br>
    In the quest for love and other ghosts<br>
    But such a preset hasn’t helped me any<br>
                I’ve been eluded<br>
                At almost every corner<br>
                Slowed and hindered<br>
                I’ve been stopped at boundaries<br>
                And sent away from almost every coast</p>
                            And I have lived my life like a wasted hour
                            On the station platform of a boarding train
                            And before I die I only hope god willing 
                            I may say that I did not live my life in vain
 
    <p>So at last I have come to the brink of something<br>
    Some valley or some sun must lie beyond these hills<br>
    I know I told you that someday I’d settle <br>
                Maybe down with someone<br>
                Maybe up with creditors<br>
                For maybe less than happiness<br>
                Or for more than sorrow<br>
                But I’m beginning to wonder if I ever will<br>
    I’ve prepared for this for many years now<br>
    To be ready for whatever’s coming with the storm<br>
                The hours late<br>
                Everyone is sleeping<br>
                The bells are silent<br>
                The stars are dying<br>
                The highway’s empty<br>
                The wind is rising<br>
                The dust is stirring <br>
                The chains are rattling<br>
                The babes are kicking waiting to be born</p>
                            And I have lived my life like a polished arrow
                            In the crowded quiver on a marksman’s back
                            And before I die I only hope, God willing 
                            That I may see that light before it all fades to black

    <h2>Every Morning</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I roll out of bed<br>
    got a thousand dreams and nightmares running through my head<br>
    not a one of which stays<br>
    my fears are no match for the exhaustion I’ve been feeling these days<br>
    behind me my love’s sleeping soundly<br>
    the bedsheet she clings to wraps half-way around me<br>
    she never seems to cease to astound me—even asleep<br>
                she stretches her arms and turns off the alarms which she’s set by the bed as a warning<br>
                but her eyes remain closed till the old rooster crows and the first rays of dawn shyly show</p>
                            Every morning
 
    <p>It’s pouring down sleet<br>
    Weatherman’s made all kinds of promises he just couldn’t keep<br>
    I’d sure hate to be him<br>
    If I expected any less than the worst I don’t know where I’d begin<br>
    I’d probably have to make a decision<br>
    Have to devise a clear position<br>
    I’d probably have to make it my mission not to be wrong<br>
                She says with a smile we’ll stay in for a while and let the weather outside go on storming<br>
                And if it never lets up we don’t have to get up, we’ll just carefully uninterrupt</p>
                            Every morning
 
    <p>I go for a walk<br>
    Buy a cup of coffee at the grocer’s where the tvs talk<br>
    A man says my name<br>
    He says, “And how are you today?” I tell him, “I’m the same.”<br>
    He says, “Are you quite sure about that?” I tell him, “I am, as a matter of fact,”<br>
    He says, “Hey, do you want your change back?” I say, “No.”<br>
                She says that it’s old but by the time she’s grown cold she’s already shown signs of warming<br>
                And her clothing is strewn all over my room as I lie in bed just waiting for noon</p>
                            Every morning
 
    <p>Lastnight is a blur<br>
    I don’t recall what we did, who we went with, or where we were<br>
    She don’t seem concerned<br>
    She says a night that’s best left forgotten is a lesson learned<br>
    At least that’s the way that she leaves it<br>
    When the newspaper comes she unwraps and she reads it<br>
    Occasionally she’ll say, “Aw, who needs it anyway?”<br>
                With a swell of her breath and one blow from her breath she keeps the frost on the windows from forming<br>
                And as suspicions accrue, her love remains true, and her mercy is new</p>
                            Every morning

    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>You can crawl in through my window<br>
    No one has to know you’re here<br>
    Mama’s tired cause she’s been working<br>
    If we’re quiet, she won’t hear<br>
                Dad’ll have the TV playin<br>
                He’ll be asleep fore long I’m sure<br>
                Baby crawl in through my window<br>
                You can leave through the front door</p>
 
    <p>You know sometimes I get the feelin<br>
    That you’ve been playin me for a fool<br>
    When I call you never answer<br>
    And you don’t talk to me at school<br>
                But every night that I come over<br>
                You say I’m the one you’re waiting for<br>
                Can’t you crawl in through my window<br>
                Like I’m always crawling out of yours?</p>
 
    <p>There’s an alley behind my building<br>
    You can get there through the gate<br>
    If you stand up on the trashcan<br>
    You can reach the fire escape<br>
                You can walk right up to my room<br>
                Apartment’s on the seventh floor<br>
                Baby crawl in through my window<br>
                And you can leave through the front door</p>
 
    <p>I know you built your reputation<br>
    Refusing what you’re supposed to be<br>
    You hate your parents and their station<br>
    That’s why you hang around with me<br>
                But you know there ain’t no pressure<br>
                The choice is obviously yours<br>
                But if you crawl in through my window<br>
                You can leave through the front door    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Nothing To Write Home About, 2020</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#nothingToWriteHomeAbout_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Said the head to the heart, “There is no cause to worry<br>
    There is no reason to fear<br>
    If you got something to tell her, man, well do it—but hurry<br>
    If you need I will be right here,”<br>
                Said the heart to the Head, “I wish it were so simple<br>
                I wish there were no obstructions or blocks<br>
                But I worry if I speak my tongue may stumble<br>
                And I will wind up the laughingstock…”<br>
    Said the head to the heart, “I will mind the tongue<br>
    I will outfit it with the cleverest phrase<br>
    I will compare her complexion to the golden sun<br>
    So that she will not fail to sing your praise,”<br>
                Said the heart to the Head, “I would it were so easy<br>
                A matter of knowing just what word to use<br>
                But if I reveal my desires and she doesn’t need me<br>
                Then the only chance I have, I’ll lose…”<br>
    Said the head to the heart, “Then I will keep them hidden<br>
    So that she will not suspect the truth<br>
    And if she happens to notice your pained expression<br>
    I will tell her it is in your tooth…”<br>
                Said the heart to the Head, “I wish it were so straightforward<br>
                As to be covered up by that disguise<br>
                But even if I tell her that my mouth is tortured<br>
                She will surely see it in my eyes…”<br>
    Said the Head to the Heart, “I will keep them closed, then,<br>
    So your love of her will not be known<br>
    And if she asks you please to let them open<br>
    I will play indifference like a stone,”<br>
                Said the Heart to the Head, “Would that it were no harder<br>
                Than pretending to be unaware<br>
                But the moment I attempt to disregard her<br>
                My lungs, they will want for air…”</p>
 
    <p>Said the heart to the head, “Will you keep me breathing<br>
                Will you keep my words from fading and receding? <br>
                Is our signal clear for you to keep receiving?<br>
                Shall I speak to her, head, now that she’s speaking?<br>
                Shall I pursue her, head, now that she’s leaving? <br>
                Can you hear me over that constant beating?<br>
                That sounds like a buffalo herd, stampeding?<br>
                Is this a question, head, that needs repeating?<br>
                Can you hear me over that constant beating? <br>
                did you hear what I said? Excuse me did you hear what I said?”<br>

    Of my death, when I am gone<br>
    Please break it to her soft and gently<br>
    Tell her that I suffered none</p>
 
    <p>O tell her that I’s aboard a freighter<br>
    Upon Superior, bound from Duluth<br>
    O tell her that our ship was sunken<br>
    But O please spare her the awful truth</p>
 
    <p>Or tell her that I’s in an aircraft<br>
    And that our plane fell from the sky<br>
    And if she asks to know what happened<br>
    Please see to it that you lie</p>
 
    <p>Please don’t let on I was in trouble<br>
    Or that I stole more than a dime<br>
    For if she knew how I was living<br>
    The shame would kill me a second time</p>
 
    <p>Please don’t let on I was unhappy<br>
    I often wrote her to say I’s well<br>
    There are some things one can’t help hiding<br>
    There are some things one should not tell</p>

    There’s none to keep her company<br>
    She had no one to put her faith in<br>
    Her hopes and dreams were all on me</p>
 
    <p>Now I have met three kinds of angels:<br>
    And two of them were heavenly<br>
    But twas the angel they call heroine<br>

    <p>I’ve not always heeded your sage advice which you’ve been given out to me since I was a kid<br>
    I know you’ve had to work hard, to sacrifice, so I could have all the chances that you never did<br>
                Nine times in ten you’ve been correct,<br>
                it seems I’ve been wrong ten in nine<br>
                You know I’m grateful, but with all due respect, <br>
                you haven’t let me ask for help in the longest time</p>
                            I know it’s hard to hear, it kinda hurts to say
                            But you gotta let me find my own way
 
    <p>I wasn’t cut out to fill your shoes, you know I’ve barely just grown into my own pair<br>
    You never said so, but you planted clues, enough for me to know you’ve always been right there<br>
                I know I’m not one from whom there’s much to expect<br>
                There’s a great deal between us we just don’t understand<br>
                I’m grateful for you, but with all due respect<br>
                I have no interest in the life you’ve planned</p>
                            So please I hope you don’t take this the wrong way
                            But you gotta let me find my own way 
 
    <p>I know you worry about just what I’ll do, when it comes to the future I’ve never looked ahead too far<br>
    Nothing I’ve done has been very well thought-through, with my debts and schemes and now, this old guitar<br>
                Your concerns they are not hard to detect<br>
                By now I can almost guess just what they’ll be<br>
                It’s not a bad thing, dad, but with all due respect<br>
                I wish you’d leave my problems up to me</p>
                            So if you would please, let come what may—
                            You gotta let me find my own way
 
    <p>The pioneers, their days are done; there are no new lands left to find<br>
    But every person, every single one, must learn this lesson in his own time<br>
                There is no telling of what ships I’ve wrecked<br>
                Of what precious chances I’ve let fall and break<br>
                But I gotta tell ya, with all due respect,<br>
                Those decisions were never yours to make</p>
                            I’m glad you’ve been here, but you won’t be here some day
                            You gotta let me find my own way

                Kind of reminds me of—myself<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself</p>
 
    <p>You got one foot on a banana peel<br>
    Other’s steppin out on a roller-skate<br>
    You’re so mixed up you don’t know how you feel<br>
    There’s none to whom you feel you can relate<br>
                The road your on’s just getting hillier<br>
                You tried it slow and fast, nothin’s helped<br>
                Something bout you, tho, seems familiar<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself</p>
 
    <p>Nothin lasts, everything falls apart<br>
    If not sooner, well, later, then<br>
    I’ve read all about the so-called “broken heart”<br>
    Examined a textbook specimen<br>
                It starts out warm, but just gets chillier<br>
                Eventually, it declines in health<br>
                There’s something bout it, seems familiar<br>
                Kind of reminds me of—myself<br>
                Kind of reminds me of myself     </p>

    <p>If the flesh that hangs upon my bones should whither and decay<br>
    And Death      from stealing me                     no longer can abstain<br>
    If Time            decomposes me and a                         breeze blows me away<br>

    <p>If I give away all that I own, along with my body, to be burned<br>
    If I surrendered every ounce that I contain<br>
    If my wisdom walked out on me with every lesson I ever learned<br>
    My love for you<br>

    <p>At the very end when the world is done, and everything is past<br>

    <p>Further than the boundary of what you or I can know<br>

    Here, where you’ve already been, and wherever you may go<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you will remain</p>
 
    <p>Tomorrow, when you are wakened by the unassuming and rosey fingered dawn<br>
    And some birdsong comes up rising through your pane<br>
    Remember that tho I myself and every trace of me is gone<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you<br>
    My love for you will remain    </p>

    <h2>The Poverty Line</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Roubles and Kopecks, 2020</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#roublesAndKopecks_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Chorus If I had a quarter for every time<br>
    Somebody told me to make up my mind<br>
    I would have enough money to be nickled and dimed<br>
    All the way back to the poverty line</p>
 
    <p>They tell me I’m poor cause I don’t like to work<br>
But I don’t see any rich folks with their hands in the dirt<br>
Show me a job where I won’t get hurt<br>
And I’ll show you a man who is eager to work</p>
 
    <p>They tell me I’m poor cause I spend all my cash<br>
I don’t have any savings, I can’t hoard a stash<br>
I get paid twice a month, it goes up in a flash<br>
Rent, groceries, insurance—well, you do the math<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>They say time is money and there’s plenty to earn<br>
But you gotta have some to begin with, to burn<br>
And the only lesson you’re able to learn<br>
Is that you can’t get ahead by just waiting your turn</p>
 
    <p>There’s a few of you up there who have all the best<br>
Your fiercest competitors couldn’t keep you abreast<br>
But some of us got nothing, most of us have less<br>
It’s take care of yourself—to hell with the rest<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>you say communism like it’s a bad word<br>
but capitalism ain’t the best one I’ve heard<br>
when you stop and think rationally, it’s kind of absurd<br>
you get richer and richer off the poor and conquered</p>
 
    <p>cause your politics works like a revolving door<br>
there’s a million rules and no one’s keeping score<br>
the rich think they’ve earned what they won at the door<br>
and what’s worse they believe that I choose to be poor<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>They tell me I’m poor because my investments aint wise<br>
I could’ve made millions, only I never tried<br>
But the distance from wealthy to here is too wide<br>
I’m starting to think maybe somebody lied</p>
 
    <p>Sure, I went to college, even got a degree<br>
but it didn’t do a whole hell of a lot of good for me<br>
education’s a blessing, but it sure isn’t free<br>
now I’ll be payin it off til I’m 103<br>
chorus</p>
 
    <p>you can go back to work or you can go back to jail<br>
but you don’t have the capital to get out on bail<br>
and you don’t have the money for any more ale<br>
and the ship you were waiting for just pulled up its sail</p>
 
    <p>so I’ll hoist myself up and I’ll put on my hat<br>
and I’ll just keep starving til I’m all out of fat<br>
if my options tween living like a bug or a rat<br>
well what in the hell kind of an option is that?<br>

    <p>I wouldn’t do it as a favor<br>
    I wouldn’t do it as a good Samaratin<br>
    I wouldn’t do it as your neighbor<br>
    I wouldn’t do it as your one and only friend<br>
                I wouldn’t do it for my family or my country<br>
                because I wanted or needed to—<br>
    I’m only in it for the money—<br>
    I hate to say it, but it’s true</p>
 
    <p>See the landlord turnin profit<br>
    turning out a family from their home<br>
    if you ask him why he doesn’t stop it<br>
    he’ll tell you go and leave me alone!<br>
    They come abused and broken and hungry— <br>
    I gave em four walls and a roof<br>
    I’m only in it for the money<br>
    That’s the sad but awful truth</p>
 
    <p>See the noble prosecutor<br>
    Making speeches for the jury sitting-by<br>
    Goin on about a shooter<br>
    Sayin every killer deserves to die<br>
                When he tells it, he tells it bloody<br>
                Without so much as one shred of substantial proof<br>
                But he’s only in it for the money<br>
                Doesn’t care at all about the truth</p>
 
    <p>Here comes your doctor to the rescue<br>
    he’s been on call and you know he hasn’t slept<br>
    he’s askin if the nurse has prepped you<br>
    and what kinds of outcomes you can expect<br>
                his hands are trembling as he makes ready <br>
                says, “if you don’t make it, this’ll be goodbye<br>
                I’m only in it for the money—<br>
                Is there any better reason why?”</p>
 
    <p>See the young entrepreneur<br>
    He’s invented something no one really needs<br>
    it’s somehow come to be quite popular<br>
    it’s catching on like wildfire overseas<br>
                to make it only costs a penny<br>
                the lives of those who buy it all get wrecked <br>
                but he’s only in it for the money<br>
                never mind the side effects</p>
 
    <p>Hear all them politicians squawkin<br>
    Claiming to be the change this country needs<br>
    I get fed up with all that talkin<br>
    And even more fed up with all their doublecrossin low-down deeds<br>
                They say they love you and this country<br>
                All they wanna do is keep it free—<br>
                But they’re only in it for the money <br>
                it’s plain enough to see— </p>
 
    <p>See the preacher in the pulpit<br>
    Quoting scripture at the bored-faced Sunday mass<br>
    Saying “Give, if you can spare it!<br>
    Give all you got and then give that plate a pass—”<br>
                He says a prayer and when he’s done he<br>
                Says, We worship God above all else! <br>
                But ain’t he in it for the money?<br>
                Ain’t he just like everybody else?</p>

    <p>Filled my gastank up with gas—I had to pay the man<br>
    Cop pulled me over for drivin too fast—I had to pay the man<br>
    Pulled up straight to an old toll-gate where a fella held out his hand<br>
    I mistook it, and shook it—and then I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>I ate something that made me sick—I had to pay the man<br>
    I needed medical attention quick—I had to pay the man<br>
    Doctor performed an operation, took out a swollen gland<br>
    He said I’s lucky, he saved my life—and I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>Woe is me is nothing free in this godforsaken land?<br>
                Can’t I even own what’s mine—no ifs buts or ands<br>
                I work all day for a measly pay, I’m so tired I can hardly stand<br>
                As soon as I get off the clock I got to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>I took my girlfriend out to eat—I had to pay the man<br>
    Wanted to use the W.C.—I had to pay the man <br>
    Fella’s in the bathroom givin out towels, sayin they’re to dry my hands<br>
    Then he looks at me expectantly—I had to pay the man </p>
 
    <p>I went to visit mom and dad—I had to pay the man<br>
    Took a bus, a train, and a taxi-cab—I had to pay the man<br>
    When I got home I’s so worked up I shut the door and it slammed<br>
    My father says, “you know the rules,” –and I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I wanted to use a utility—I had to pay the man<br>
    Water, heat, electricity—I had to pay the man<br>
    the furnace popped and the power stopped and the water it froze and jammed<br>
    had to call someone to fix em all—and I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>Well on Sunday I went down to mass—and I had to pay the man<br>
    arrived just in time for the plate to pass—and I had to pay the man<br>
    Father said, “You won’t be judged—just give up what you can,”<br>
    But I swear I couldn’t get out them doors—until after I paid the man</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I expect one night I’ll go and die—and I’ll have to pay the man<br>
    Folks’ll gather round and cry—and I’ll have to pay the man<br>
    Let my epitaph be plain—I don’t want nothing grand<br>
    Let it read: “I’s born, I lived, and I had to pay the man” </p>
 
    <p>Bound or free, alive or dead—I had to pay the man<br>
    Didn’t matter what no one said—I had to pay the man<br>
    Well I wanted to know where my money’s goin—I wanted to understand<br>
    I asked the first person I met—I had to pay the man</p>
 
    <p>I went ahead and checked my facts—about having to pay the man<br>
    Seems every time I pay a tax—I’m payin uncle Sam<br>
    He spends it so our planes can go drop bombs on a foreign land<br>
    He says I shouldn’t be concerned, it’s all-American </p>
 
    <p>If my money’s gonna fund a war—I ain’t gonna pay the man<br>
    If it’ll get a kid killed on a foreign shore—I ain’t gonna pay the man<br>
    When we got bad schools right here at home, poverty to beat the band<br>
    I’d rather pay a teacher’s salary than to pay that awful man     </p>

    <p>I left my home a young man, sights set on the city<br>
    Aimed to take the first job I could do<br>
    Got hired on the nightshift, paid to drive a forklift<br>
    Had to learn to sleep the whole day through</p>
 
    <p>I met a sweet old lady who owned a small apartment<br>
    Said I could live with her, didn’t that sound great?<br>
    But I didn’t live there cheaply, had to pay bi-weekly<br>
    And she charged me every hour I was late</p>
 
    <p>Neath the risin cost of livin in a world that never pays<br>
                You can get by for a while takin what comes free<br>
                But its trine to make a livin on a no good livin wage<br>
                That’s the only thing that’s killing me</p>
 
    <p>I don’t mind the lack of benefits, the late-long working hours<br>
    Or that they ask me to do overtime each week<br>
    Ain’t like I got a family, or time enough to start one<br>
    Or any living friend of which to speak</p>
 
    <p>but the thing that really gets me, that frustrates and upsets me<br>
    is that I ain’t managed to save even a cent<br>
    cause what don’t go to gas, electric, garbage, fuel, and food<br>
    just goes to payin off my rent</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I’ve heard some folks die of drowning, others of poisoning, electrocution<br>
    some die madly fleeing death’s persistent call<br>
    some die because they’re stranded, heartbroken and abandoned, <br>
    others die for no good reason at all</p>
 
    <p>people die of falling objects, parachutes that didn’t open<br>
    some are murdered, some just die of old age<br>
    but if I live to be 99 I’ll still die of simply trine<br>
    to live on nothing but my living wage</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#roublesAndKopecks_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>They’re building up the city—everybody’s making room<br>
    they’re putting up their signs that say—apartments coming soon!<br>
    All the people who once lived there, who had to sell their properties<br>
    are now gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>the word’s “gentrification”—and you might think it means progress<br>
    and if you’re lookin to move in here, it probably does, I guess<br>
    but if you’ve passed your life here, if you’re someone like me<br>
    you know “gentrification” means “refugee”</p>
 
    <p>Developers are coming in—they’re buying all the land<br>
    They’re building everything brand new, according to their plans<br>
    They talk about creating a strong community<br>
    Without the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>Now you don’t have to move out, the developers all say<br>
    But the rent’s about quadrupled, so you’ll go broke if you stay<br>
    I guess the “neighborhood improvement” don’t apply to me<br>
    I’m a gentrification refugee</p>
 
    <p>My parents lived in this house—since the day that they were wed<br>
    I always thought I’d be here til they carried me out dead<br>
    When the moving truck pulls out of here, let the bumper sticker read:<br>
    Gentrification refugee</p>
 
    <p>They bulldozed the old Woolworth’s—built a high-rise parkinglot<br>
    Tore out the mom and pop place, put in a corporate coffeeshop<br>
    What will mom and pop do in their old age and bankruptcy?<br>
    As new gentrification refugees?</p>
 
    <p>They turned the old cathedral into a climbing gym<br>
    they demolished the old high school, put a strip-mall in <br>
    What they’re going to change next—I won’t be here to see <br>
    I’m a gentrification refugee </p>
 
    <p>Now there’s plenty of things to do here—no, you never will get bored<br>
    Unless the entertainment’s more than you can afford<br>
    If you can’t pay for admission, join the caravan for free<br>
    Of the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>Demographic’s changing, it’s a new population<br>
    Poor blacks is bein swept out—white money’s movin in<br>
    You can draw a hard line tween the new folks of the city <br>
    And the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>They say don’t be nostalgiac—change it can be good<br>
    But there’s nothing familiar about my own neighborhood<br>
    It won’t stay this way for long—that’s a timeless prophesy<br>
    But I’m a gentrification refugee</p>
 
    <p>Where’m I sposed to go now? I haven’t got a home<br>
    Nowhere I can be at rest, no place to call my own<br>
    I guess I’ll hit the highway, long with friends and family<br>
    Join the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>They say not to get angry—the times is all that you can blame<br>
    But I lived here all my life so far, rent’s always been the same<br>
    Somebody must’ve sold out, for a little do-re-me<br>
    Joined the gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>It’s happenin in New York and the San Fransisco Bay<br>
    In all the major cities all across the USA<br>
    It’s happening most everywhere I can’t afford to be<br>
    They’re makin gentrification refugees</p>
 
    <p>You can’t just be a victim, tho I know it’s hard to fathom<br>
    Every place you go now, you’re just adding to the problem<br>
    They say gentrification’s caused by rambling folks like me<br>
    Tho I’m gentrification’s refugee    </p>

    From the bay of fransisco to the new jersey shore<br>
    Just some place to be was all that I’s lookin for<br>
    But I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I did a job for a guy he never paid me for<br>
    I don’t hold it against him tho he promised and swore<br>
    I forgive all my debtors, and I’ll always be poor<br>
    Cause I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I’s down on my luck, I needed help pretty sore<br>
    I’s waiting on aces—and I got handed all four<br>
    I said, “I’m all in,” Dealer said, “Long as you’re sure,”<br>
    And now I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I’m out on the street, it’s a quarter to four<br>
    I been sleeping in front of a mattress store<br>
    A man woke me up said, “You can’t sleep here no more,”<br>
    But I ain’t got no home in this world anymore</p>
 
    <p>I done and I thought things that have been less than pure<br>
    So I went down to the church and I pushed on the door<br>
    My hope to replenish and my faith restore<br>
    O but I ain’t got no home in this world anymore </p>
 
    <p>I’ve read terrible things in the family lore<br>
    about my brother, the killer, and my sister, the whore<br>
    but what’s anyone done I could forgive them for<br>
    when I ain’t got no home in this world anymore? </p>
 
    <p>The wind it’ll howl, the rain, it’ll pour<br>
    The blood in your veins fights the cold like a war<br>
    Out on the highway traffic rushes and roars<br>
    O but I ain’t got no home in this world anymore    </p>

    A new pair of shoes and a suit and a wife and three kids and a house and a job<br>
    And when you get tired there’s places to sleep, <br>
    and when you get hungry there’s plenty to eat<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend do you know, how to get to Easy Street?</p>
 
    <p>I heard there’s a man there, he’s a doctor of sorts, he can cure almost any disease<br>
    Ailments, addictions, afflictions and worse—all you gotta do is say please<br>
    He won’t charge you nothing, he works pretty cheap; <br>
    when he gives you his promise, you know it’ll keep<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say friend do you know, how to get to Easy Street?<br>
                Easy Street—where the livin is easy<br>

    If anyone sees you hangin around, they’ll tell you to just come on inside<br>
    They won’t ask where you been on your runaway streak; <br>
    if the cops come around, they won’t make a peep<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend, do you know, how to get to Easy Street?</p>
 
    <p>I heard that they’ve got more than enough to go round, they won’t make you stand in no lines<br>
    You can stand where you like and come as you are, there ain’t no “No Trespassin” signs<br>
    There’s no trials or contests in which to compete<br>
    There ain’t any forms that you’ll need to complete<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend, do you know—how to get to easy street?<br>
                Chorus</p>
 
    <p>I met a young man who knew the place well, he smiled, remembering it<br>
    I asked, “Can I go?” he shook his head no, said, “you haveta be born into it—<br>
    “And if you ever get out by making the leap—you’ll never get back in, the climb is too steep—<br>
    “I’m sorry to say but there’s no other way for to get to easy street.”</p>
 
    <p>I met another man claimed he came from that place, said he’s born there in some ancient year<br>
    I asked him the way and all he could say was, “Friend—you can’t get there from here,<br>
    “So if you get beaten, just turn your cheek—what you sew in joy in sorrow you’ll reap<br>
    “I’m sorry to say but there’s no other way for to get to easy street.”<br>
                Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Have you heard of this place you can make up a dream and pursue it until it comes true?<br>
    Where whatever you’ve done and where ever you’re from cant in anyway be held against you?<br>
    is there anywhere I can kick up my feet? Or get out of this rain and this godawful heat?<br>
    I’d sure like to go, say, friend, do you know how to get to easy street?     </p>

    <p>Another young black man is dead<br>
    before the age of twenty-one<br>
    Shot to death by an officer <br>
    who claimed he thought he had a gun<br>
    They’re talking bout it on the radio<br>
    There’s footage on the nightly news<br>
    Just can’t seem to get away<br>
    From the police brutality blues</p>
 
    <p>The cops are dressed in riot gear<br>
    they say my neighborhood’s secure<br>
    I used to think they were protectin me, <br>
    now they’re just wagin war<br>
                the officers are trained to kill <br>
                self-defense is their excuse     <br>
                the whole nation’s coming down with<br>
                the police brutality blues </p>
 
    <p>If a black man kills a cop<br>
    Someone will see that he will swing<br>
    If a cop kills a black-skinned kid <br>
    It doesn’t mean a goddam thing<br>
    Nevermind that he was unarmed<br>
                the ruling somehow always proves<br>
    Courts still haven’t found a cure <br>
    For the police brutality blues</p>
 
    <p>Now we’re a civilized society<br>
    That we need laws, I can understand<br>
    That don’t explain why it takes six white cops<br>
    To write a ticket to one black man<br>
                It don’t explain why he must get out <br>
                Or why he’s guilty if he refuse<br>
                It don’t explain why so many got<br>
                The police brutality blues </p>
 
    <p>A mother lays her child to rest<br>
    She’s been stricken dumb<br>
    The unarmed man they shot to death<br>
    Was a husband, a father, a son<br>
                There’s a baby in his mother’s arms<br>
                too young to know the truth <br>
                That his father had a fatal case of<br>
                the police brutality blues    </p>

    <p>I’s down and out—couldn’t find a job<br>
    Door of opportunity had a broken knob<br>
    And I don’t mind that I should have to knock<br>
    But that the line to get there goes down and around the block<br>
                You just stand there and never move<br>
                with them unemployment blues <br>
                Til the police come and you’re kicked to the curb—</p>
 
    <p>Well you want to run, and they’ll see that you crawl<br>
    You try climb and they’ll just help you fall<br>
    no way to carry what you’re made to haul<br>
    Gotta live your life with your back up against a wall<br>
                Like a turtle on its back—<br>
                In the noose and losing slack—<br>
                So that you’re never more than one step from the verge—  </p>
 
    <p>CHORUS tell me—whose hand do I have to shake?<br>
                            How long do I have to wait?
                            Do I gotta hurt somebody? What’ll it take?
                            Fore I can start to expect, and begin to collect—on a little of the respect                 
                                                                                                                I deserve?
    <p>I survived on my own little bit<br>
    I worked and sang and then I begged for it<br>
    Staying hungry’s how I kept so fit<br>
    you can’t get too far when you’re far gone in the pit—<br>
                it’s designed to keep you down<br>
                try to surface and you’ll drown<br>
                til your prison and your freedom’s gotten blurred—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Wish I could payback all that I’ve been lent<br>
    Save a little more than a half-a-cent<br>
    Earn enough to leave my tenement<br>
    But as it is, I can’t afford to pay the rent—<br>
                And the gas has been shut off<br>
                And I’ve come down with a cough—<br>
                and the debt collector’s getting on my nerves—</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>Used to be young but now I’m getting old<br>
    They’ve gotten rid of all that hasn’t sold<br>
    After years of trying, I still can’t fit the mold<br>
    Can’t seem to learn to do just what I’m told<br>
                I always gotta know what for<br>
                And even then I still ain’t sure<br>
                Authority will say: it ain’t like you heard—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>times is hard—and they’re a’getting worse<br>
    all you can pass on is an empty purse<br>
    seems everybody’s got a grudge to nurse<br>
    against themselves, each other, or the entire universe<br>
                its everybody for himself<br>
                nobody stops to lend you help<br>
                unless it’s to teach you some unfriendly word </p>

    <p>I get up in the morning when I still can’t see the light<br>
    Work without a pause or break til you can’t see again at night<br>
    Your skin turns all to leather as your hands get hurt and sore<br>
    All the while you’re wonderin: What am I even working for?<br>
                My house is just a plywood shed; my kids is barely clothed<br>
                I’m a getting on in years, how long I got, who knows?<br>
                Money in my pocket it was bought with my blood and sweat<br>
                And as long as there is work to do we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>God made the world in seven days, so the story goes<br>
    What he’s been doin ever since, there ain’t a soul who knows<br>
    He made some strange creations but the one that’s most worth seein<br>
    Is the curious experiment he called the human being<br>
                Here’s a creature, goes around looking a’low and high<br>
                For something to surrender to, to make him happy ‘fore he dies<br>
                The unvarying response to any answer it can get<br>
                Is: so long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>The earth it is a dyin off—we’ve wrecked it pretty fair<br>
    Tore down every rainforest and polluted all the air<br>
    Melted all the ice-caps and filled up the sea with trash<br>
    I don’t want to be a downer, but I don’t think it’s a gonna last<br>
                You may be a composter and recycle all your wares<br>
                You spent your life campaigning for cleaner, healthier air<br>
                You think your carbon footprint’s about as small as it can get—<br>
                But as long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>Now I come from a country, USA’s the name<br>
    Sometimes it’s a point of pride, but it’s often one of shame<br>
    The leaders in my country practice hate and bigotry<br>
    And I don’t want my representatives representing me<br>
                Our prisons are exploding and our schools is getting worse<br>
                Our healthcare system cannot seem to Put the People First<br>
                As far as the reversal goes—there’s been some progress, I’ll admit,<br>
                But so long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet</p>
 
    <p>So you’ve marched against the big machine and perhaps you won the day<br>
    Your cry for justice has been heard, and for once, things went your way<br>
    It took bout everything you had, but you came out on top<br>
    but it’ll all disintegrate again the moment that you stop— <br>
                So I’m gonna keep marchin, I ain’t lookin back<br>
                Ain’t gonna let my guard down or give out any slack <br>
                When I’m dead and in my grave that’s when I’m a gonna quit<br>
                But as long as there is work to do, we ain’t done nothing yet    </p>

    <p>He arrived in town on this morning’s train<br>
    Nevermind his business, nevermind his name<br>
    Came seekin shelter from a pourin rain<br>
    And to quench a thirst he’d probably had too long</p>
 
    <p>He stepped into a cheap hotel<br>
    Dipped the feather quill in the old ink well<br>
    Signed his name as William tell<br>
    The owner asked, “Will you be staying long?”</p>
 
    <p>Just passin through, just passin through<br>
        Didn’t come for no appointment, nor no rendezvous<br>
        Passin through, I’m just passin through<br>
        To stay for just a night, or maybe two—either way I’m only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>He had no luggage of which to speak<br>
    Just a long dark scar runnin down his cheek<br>
    Eyes that would’ve made a strong woman week<br>
    That seemed to know the truth and seek it out</p>
 
    <p>Hotel owner’s daughter, miss Eleanor<br>
    Caught sight of th stranger comin in the door<br>
    Saw that he lodged in room number four<br>
    And then she went and asked her father who he was</p>
 
    <p>He’s just passin through, just passin through<br>
        I’d leave him be, and so should you<br>
        He’s passin through, just passin through<br>
        He didn’t come to fall in love with you—leave him be, he’s only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>But her father’s warning she did not heed<br>
    She stole into his room in her stocking feet<br>
    Knocked and entered and turned the key<br>
    And by morningtime, she still had not emerged</p>
 
    <p>“O, Mr. Tell, won’t you tell me please<br>
    Is it your intention now to marry me?<br>
    Or do you still mean to up and leave?<br>
    Like you told my father that you would?”</p>
 
    <p>I’m just passin through, just passing through<br>
        Didn’t come to settle, just to see the view<br>
        Passin through, I’m just passin through<br>
        Would’ve told you but I really thought you knew—darlin, I was only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>Says Ms. Eleanor—“Well in that case,<br>
    Never again may I show my face<br>
    I will tell my father I have been disgraced, <br>
    And he will probably try to shoot you down,”</p>
 
    <p>And before ms. Eleanor’s speech was done,<br>
    In comes her father with a big shotgun<br>
    Says to Mr. Tell, “Won’t you tell me son,<br>
    Just what it is you think that you are doin?”</p>
 
    <p>I’m just passin through, just passin through<br>
        Now that I’ve stayed I best be getting to<br>
        Passin through, just passin through<br>
        Didn’t come to quarrel with the likes of you—you know I was only passin thru</p>
 
    <p>“Well not so fast,” the hotel owner said<br>
    “Either you’ll marry sweet ellie here, or else you’ll be dead!”<br>
    And he aimed that gun at poor william’s head<br>
    Said, “Tell me, tell, what’s it gonna be?”</p>
 
    <p>To William’s defense, Eleanor leapt to<br>
    The father panicked, shot poor willy through<br>
    and as the daughter cried, “what did you do?”<br>
    William tell, he spoke these final words:</p>
 
    <p>Passin through, just passin through<br>
        Life sure ain’t long and there ain’t much to do<br>
        The pains are many and the pleasure’s few<br>
        I’ll die now, but someday so will you—all of us, we’re only passin through</p>
 
    <p>Passin through, just passin through<br>
        With time enough to say hello, adieu<br>
        Passin through, just passin through<br>
        Just like every single breath you drew—All of us—we’re only passin through     </p>

    <p>Yesterday the well dried up and the drought has just begun<br>
    We never prayed for more than just a little more than none<br>
    Fella from the bank dropped by with a mortgage and a deed<br>
    Said I could either sign them or he’d sign them both for me<br>
    Said he knew my troubles, knew my work, my pain, my need<br>
    Couldn’t tell if he was talking out of duty or just greed</p>
 
    <p>Ma and pa were farmers and they died relatively young<br>
    Thank god they didn’t live to see what their children would become<br>
    Cassius makes his livin givin hungry folks the heave<br>
    Gets the D.A. to arrest the ones he cannot get to leave<br>
    Now he carries round his rifle drinking whiskey from a sleeve<br>
    And he’s still as poor as they are, and well, as for me</p>
 
    <p>I’m just gonna wait here on this land I used to own<br>
        Til the houses fall to ruin and the pastures have regrown<br>
        Til the countryside is silenced as the gears of progress moan<br>
        Til over my dead body the winds of change have blown<br>
        til I’m nothing but a worn out washed up stack of farmer’s bones<br>
        I’m just gonna wait here til my cows come home</p>
 
    <p>Guess I’m just too sad to laugh, and still too proud to cry<br>
    Too old to learn, too poor to move, too young to die<br>
    Ma always said I always was as stubborn as the mule<br>
    Just like my paw who had the reputation for the fool<br>
    Who always said you won’t find education in a school<br>
    Nor kindness in a good deed, nor the just life in the rule</p>
 
    <p>All the weeds have gone to seed, and the barns in disrepair<br>
    Nothing left to sell at market and no livestock for the fair<br>
    Sold the silo and the greenhouse, the tractor and the plow<br>
    Sold the chickens and the henhouse, the horses and the cows<br>
    Sold it all believing we would get it back somehow<br>
    And the newsreporter wants to know just what will we do now?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>They say history repeats itself, there’s a time for everything<br>
    A time to reap to sew to live to die to mourn to sing<br>
    They’ll tell you to be quiet as though your breathin were a waste<br>
    They’ll tell you to look here now, as though the music could be faced<br>
    They’ll tell you that it’s over, as though your dreams could be erased<br>
    Make sure your dreams are big enough you don’t lose them in the chase</p>
 
    <p>Mattie says she’s got a family waiting way out in the west<br>
    And not too much to carry she can hitch a ride I guess<br>
    Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a flour-sack<br>
    They been gone three weeks now, and probably won’t come back<br>
    Last I saw of john-boy he was headed for the tracks<br>
    With nothing but a canteen and the clothes upon his back<br>
    Maybe someday I will follow, if I can ever get the knack<br>
    Til then</p>

    <h2>The Bargain</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Unravelled Tales - Volume 1, 2021</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales1_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>One day, long ago at the oaks of Mamre God upon Abraham called<br>
    To splain the haviors of his fellow man and tell him why man is worth saving:</p>
 
    <p>“Hey man, Abraham, where have you been? Through all creation I been searchin for ya<br>
    To tell you I’m gwin in one day’s time to destroy Sodom and Gamorrah”</p>
 
    <p>Abe said, “Hey there God, you sure got me thinking a lot and I think I got a proposition for ya<br>
    Say there’s sixty-two men in those cities of sin<br>
    With no idea of the bad shape they’re in<br>
    And no one to tell them how it’s all gonna end<br>
    And no chance to change if there’s no change to send<br>
    If I should show you sixty-two righteous men<br>
    Then would you save us in Sodom and Gamorrah?”</p>
 
    <p>Well God put his finger up to his chin, he said, “Abe, you ain’t trine to bargain are ya?<br>
    I am The Lord, almighty and vain, and I made thee and I can destroy ya,”</p>
 
    <p>Abe said, “Not so hot, now you got me on the spot, and if you’ll let me I’ve got an answer for ya<br>
    An injustice it seems that for a percentage share<br>
    You would presume to know every single person there<br>
    From the language in his teeth to the color of his hair<br>
    From his midnight grin to his twilight stare<br>
    Say, if this is how you judge then what do you even care<br>
    Who lives or dies in Sodom and Gamorrah?”</p>
 
    <p>God said, “Alright, I am not gonna fight—go, you gotcher self till tumarrya<br>
    To find sixty-two men of the righteousest of ken, to spare you in Sodom and Gamorrah.”</p>
 
    <p>Well, then Abraham thought, “Well, sixty-two sure seems a lot<br>
    For forty would the bargain still stand for ya?”<br>
    God willingly agreed he said, “If forty’s all you need,<br>
    Then it’s forty, and I’ll see you tumarrya.”</p>
 
    <p>As God turned to go, Abe shouted from below, “Wait a minute, you’re not finished talkin are ya?<br>
    If forty’s understood then wouldn’t twenty be just as good<br>
    And would twenty satisfy any better than twelve would?<br>
    And would you take even a dozen of the best men if you could?<br>
    And even if you could, you should ask whether you should<br>
    When what makes a righteous man is but barely understood<br>
    On penalty of contract, autographed in blood<br>
    Imposed upon a people you once washed out with a flood<br>
    Is it really any wonder we don’t behave as we should<br>
    But go ahead and tell me, and please, be honest if you would, <br>
    cause I got pity for Sodom and Gamorrah.”</p>
 
    <p>God said, “Abe, I’m amazed in this game you wanna play,<br>
    Is it really all that important for ya?<br>
    Very well, let’s be plain, find me even one good name, <br>
    And I’ll spare your precious Sodom and Gamorrah.”</p>
 
    <p>Well the evening came and went, soon Abe’s time was nearly spent<br>
    To Mamre went Abraham on the morrow<br>
    And God laughed when he saw the lonesome tired Abraham<br>
    And he said, “Poor Abe, you’re not really surprised now, are ya?”</p>
 
    <p>Abe said, “You earn your love through fear<br>
    I earn mine through love<br>
    Tho you may be omniscient, omnipresent and all that,<br>
    You don’t know what it’s like to live down here.”     </p>

    <p>I’ve been trying to remember the way this story starts<br>
    That increases in confusion, goes off the rails in parts,<br>
    That catalogues the romance of an idiot savant<br>
    Who never can quite manage to decide what it is he wants…<br>
    And goes on to lend the details of secret that was kept<br>
    So well that all the pieces fail to meaningfully connect…<br>
    Who placed her on a pedestal which he named his Stumblingblock<br>
    And was the only souvenir he had when he became the laughingstock…</p>
 
    <p>There’s a sign-post lost in ivy at the old fork in the road<br>
    One arrow points to nowhere, the other towards the motherload<br>
    But the traveler’s in a snowdrift, and he hasn’t yet found out<br>
    That the footprints he’s been following are his own, without a doubt<br>
    And the carriage-driver’s mumbling, he’s been known for nodding off<br>
    I heard he killed a man once who accused him of being lost<br>
    but the circle’s ever-widening, every revolution grows <br>
    the time it takes for one to realize what everyone already knows…</p>
 
    <p>And still I feel the strange sensation that I’ve had this dream before<br>
    because I’m not participating, I’m just the one who’s keeping score<br>
    the cups were filled with coffee by the waitress with the pin<br>
    who poisons her own lipstick and leaves it showing on the brim<br>
    The hallway chatterboxes are all waiting to descend<br>
    Upon a service elevator that cannot rise as high as them<br>
    The fire on the mountain has gotten kind out of hand<br>
    There’s no method to distinguish between the innocent and damned—</p>
 
    <p>The clock’s a double-crosser—else how’d the hour get so late?<br>
    And what happened to the lobster that was just resting on my plate?<br>
    I didn’t mean to interrupt you—we were somewhere in the meal<br>
    Either I was asking you, or you were wondering how I feel—<br>
    The bartender looks impatient for the commercials to resume<br>
    In the backyard a slumped hound-dog being howled at by a moon<br>
    beneath the porter’s window the station’s leaving from the train<br>
    I guess I’m a little empty, kinda lost and scatterbrained…</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been to see the barber at the dark end of the cave<br>
    You can tell when he’s been drinking by the closeness of his shave<br>
    There’s a headstone in the parlor, it’s been leaning gainst the stairs<br>
    I’m afraid I’ll turn it over and find my own name written there<br>
    I climbed up on my ladder for to call on you again<br>
    But the candle’s always burning in the room you’re never in<br>
    Have you ever been so lonely that you shattered into song<br>
    And felt you’d found a place at last where you could just belong?    </p>

    <p>Well everybody’s got a thing to say about the girl there dancing across the way<br>
    How her hair flows and her hips, they sway—all night long<br>
    Where she comes from and who she is, how she got into a place like this,<br>
    These are all things that these watchers wish they knew for sure<br>
    Some say that she’s a queen from a country somewhere that no one’s seen<br>
    Where everything that you hope and dream, it just comes true</p>
 
    <p>Where they go: Sha la la la la la la Sha la la la la la la<br>
                Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la</p>
 
    <p>Some say that she’s a married girl who’s traveled half way around the world<br>
    Searching for her precious pearl, a man she loves<br>
    Some say that she’s a widowed wife, that she’s been dancing here all her life<br>
    Mourning morning noon and night a man she loves<br>
    Nobody seems to know her name, or speak her language or play her game<br>
    But every evening, moon stars or rain, she dances here<br>
    She wears what I wouldn’t quite call a smile, opens her eyes every once in a while<br>
    She’s dangerous and versatile, she seems to say<br>
    With her there its hard to concentrate, everything else feels second rate<br>
    Mostly folks they just speculate as they stand in awe<br>
    They wonder does she even know that she’s the reason for the crowded show<br>
    That she’s the reason that the music’s slow and the hour’s late<br>
    To have danced with her none can boast, won’t let nobody get too close<br>
    Some people say that she’s just a ghost, that she ain’t there<br>
    She don’t like licorice, only caramel; don’t like dresses but she wears them well<br>
    You’ve never met her but she rings a bell inside of you<br>
    She keeps her balance with an expert skill, looks like she’s dancing when she’s standin still<br>
    You can’t tell if it’s love until she tries to go<br>
    And every evening when the music’s done and the bar is closing for the morning sun<br>
    There’s no one left, she’s the only one who’s dancing still<br>
    She has this way where she leaves a room smelling strongly of her sweet perfume<br>
    Humming softly a spanish tune as her footsteps fade<br>
    And all the boys come and gather round and try to recognize the sound<br>
    Declare the dance floor to be hallowed ground as she slips away</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>

    <p>a gambler’s a man / who knows that a plan’s / just a story that’s spun out of dreams<br>
    it can act as a prop / to get you to stop / but temporary is all that it means<br>
    sooner than not / you’ll get what you’ve bought / whether you lose or you win<br>
    I’ve lost my share / but look, I’m still here / so, dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>I seen all kinds / from the ones who read minds / to them who can’t spot a tell from a bluff<br>
    To the burn-outs, retired / hard-lucks, hardwired / who can’t say when they’ve had enough<br>
    I’ve heard the advice / of them who say to think twice / what do they know about where I been?<br>
    If you had these blues / I’ll wager you, too / ‘d be sayin: Dealer, deal me again</p>
 
    <p>I had me a girl / she was out of this world / she was a once-in-a-lifetime affair<br>
    I asked her to stay / she told me o.k. / then she high-tailed it right out of there<br>
    I heard through the mill / she’s been up to it still / making fools out of dangerous men<br>
    Still causin a stir / Ain’t that good for her? / Dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>Some play for the thrill / for the hunt or the kill / for the chance to be something they’re not<br>
    Some play cause they know / just how it will go / so long as they never get caught<br>
    Me, I’m the sort / who lives for the sport / I play for sheer love of the game<br>
    Don’t matter what / poker straight, draw or stud / Dealer, just deal me again</p>
 
    <p>When it was you / I did what I could do / to let you know I was your friend<br>
    I held you aside / to defend you, I lied / and if I had to, I’d do it again<br>
    But now it’s reversed / and I come to you first / you act like you don’t know who I am—<br>
    If I’m still in the game / and the rules haven’t changed / well dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>You tried to live straight / as something you hate / and you know that it won’t ever fit<br>
    It’s a gamble as soon / as you’re torn from the womb / til you finally cash in your chips<br>
    To live is to bet / in a game against Death / and you know the house wins in the end<br>
    But if it’s all gone to hell / spose I might as well… / Dealer, won’t you deal me again?</p>
 
    <p>I’m friends with the bar / doorman’s got a car / there’d be more than enough to go round<br>
    a few guns, for show / and a place to lay low / where we could wait for the heat to die down<br>
    maybe it’s how you feel / or it’s there in the deal / or it’s some kind of wheel you just spin<br>
    you won’t know til it lands / or you’ve played out your hand / Dealer, won’t you deal me again?    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales1_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I went down to the poolhall / late on a Tuesday<br>
    nothing but a dollar to my name<br>
    I was only looking / to pass some hours<br>
    While I waited for my leven o’clock train</p>
 
    <p>Well I took a seat at / an empty table<br>
    It couldn’t have been no later than quarter past<br>
    There were a few games going / not a whole lot happenin<br>
    I wondered how long my dollar was gonna last</p>
 
    <p>Among the poolsharks / and grizzly fellas<br>
    I saw two hustlers taking money left and right<br>
    They were shooting doubles / telling stories<br>
    Of how this must’ve been their lucky night</p>
 
    <p>Well I got distracted / by a well-known waitress<br>
    Named Rita, wearing stockings and a fishnet blouse <br>
    She said, “You thirsty” / I said, “I got no money,”<br>
    She said, “It won’t help you—this ones on the house.”</p>
 
    <p>Well she brought me something / it was all a bubblin<br>
    I sniffed it, then I took a thirsty pull<br>
    When I brought the cup down / everyone was starin<br>
    Somebody whispered, “That man done lost his soul.”</p>
 
    <p>Well I started feeling / a little funny<br>
    And then I blacked out and fell right to the floor<br>
    When I came to / the place had cleared out<br>
    Cept for one of those two hustlers from before</p>
 
    <p>He put his hand out / said “Pleased to know you,”<br>
    I can see you’re new here, so allow me to explain:<br>
    Said, “You’re dead now / but this ain’t heaven<br>
    That there’s Rita—and Satan is my name.” </p>
 
    <p>He said, “I see your startled / that’s only natural<br>
    good news is that I’m a gambling man<br>
    if you play me / in a game of billiards<br>
    I’ll let you have your soul back, if you win.”</p>
 
    <p>Well I accepted his conditions<br>
    In my position, hell, what else could I do?<br>
    He racked the balls up, rearranged em <br>
    and then broke em while I eyed and chalked my cue</p>
 
    <p>Well the break was perfect / he made six balls in<br>
    every pocket on the table took a hit<br>
    Three were striped ones / and three were solid <br>
    Satan said, “I guess I get my pick.”</p>
 
    <p>He chose solids / and eyed the two-ball<br>
    Said, “Corner pocket,” and gave an awful grin<br>
    It looked unlikely / downright impossible<br>
    Sent the cue-ball round the table and Number 2 went in</p>
 
    <p>Then he said “Watch this,” / said, “You see that pair there?”<br>
    He pointed at the 1 up against the 3<br>
    He hit the cue ball / smack in between em<br>
    And each went in different holes, simultaneously</p>
 
    <p>Well I’s in trouble / and boy, I knew it<br>
    But I held my piece and didn’t let nothing show<br>
    He had a clean shot / on the number 7<br>
    And, of course, he made it, with just the 8 ball left to go</p>
 
    <p>When all of a sudden, he became curious<br>
    Said, “I hate to win so easy with the stakes so high”<br>
    He fired gently, grazed the eight-ball <br>
    Said, “If you think you can win, let’s see you try!” </p>
 
    <p>Well just then something made me look at Rita<br>
    she looked so lonesome, so lovely and so sad <br>
    I said to Satan, “Before I shoot here,<br>
    What do you say we revise the agreement that we had?” </p>
 
    <p>I said, “If I’m defeated, you get my spirit<br>
    It’ll be all yours to do with what you feel—<br>
    But if I win, you free Rita—”<br>
    Satan laughed and said, “That’s all? You gotta deal.”</p>
 
    <p>I said, “For a hustler, you know you’re pretty cocky<br>
    I’m surprised to know the devil even gives a damn—<br>
    I didn’t want to / haveta hurt your feelings—<br>
    but you must have no idea who I am”</p>
 
    <p>And saying that much / I took my first shot<br>
    Hit the nine into the ten into the twelve<br>
    Sunk em easy / and went on shooting<br>
    Til I cleared that entire table by myself</p>
 
    <p>When it was over / I put my hand out<br>
    Said, “I’ll be taking back our souls, now, I trust<br>
    He said “That wasn’t our agreement—”<br>
    I said “Actually, as a matter of fact, it was—” </p>
 
    <p>I explained that long time before this<br>
    Rita’s and my soul were intertwined, <br>
    “Techically speaking, I belong to her—<br>
    I’m as much a part of hers as she is of mine.”</p>
 
    <p>Sometimes folks ask me how I met Rita<br>
    How we ever came to be husband and wife<br>
    I always tell em it’s a boring story:<br>
    One time she tried to kill me, and saved my life.    </p>

    <p>There was a time when what was yours was mine—and vice versa<br>
    If I’m not on cue, I’d be more’n glad to reimburse ya<br>
    I spose it’s a flaw to believe in the law of inertia<br>
    That says what is will be—I say let’s wait and see:</p>
 
    <p>We been through our share of trial and error and judgment<br>
    Enduring the eyes of society wives and their husbands<br>
    We’ve paid all their dues and even a few of their “doesn’t”s<br>
    it’s come down to this—still, somethings amiss<br>
        I know it ain’t my place<br>
        to tell you where and when you seem a little off-base<br>
        But in this case I’d embrace<br>
        my own share of the blame— </p>
 
    <p>For your own good, for your own health<br>
        I wish you’d hold up a mirror and look at yourself<br>
    When it’s so obvious to everyone else <br>
        That you ain’t the same—<br>
    That you’re different now, there’s something new, something I can’t name<br>
    I can’t quite put my finger on it, I can’t quite explain<br>
        you’ve changed </p>
 
    <p>The thieves in the yard check to see that the guard is still dozing<br>
    the hostess distressed, accuses her guests of imposing<br>
    The butterfly sleeps while its body keeps metamorphosing<br>
    The caterpillar cocooned—I’m damned or I’m doomed</p>
 
    <p>reviewing a list of items you wished to be handed<br>
    I saw at a glance that romance had been taken for granted <br>
    I’d’ve pointed it out except doubt had me thoroughly stranded<br>
    Nowhere to go—except on with the show<br>
        I feel so at a loss<br>
        Like a freewheeling boulder trying to gather its moss<br>
        Just tell me what it will cost<br>
        And what I stand to gain—</p>
 
    <p>And in the meantime, I’ll concede<br>
        That in what I’ve undertaken I will never succeed<br>
        nor surrender, nor give in, nor need<br>
            long as you’re in the frame—<br>
        I’m not going to mince words, I’ll stand by my claim<br>
        There’s just something about you, doesn’t go with the grain—<br>
        you’ve changed</p>
 
    <p>Down in the vault the cult meeting’s called into order<br>
    A man with no voice makes a choice by flipping a quarter<br>
    Someone disagrees and is made to eat cheese in the corner<br>
    Reciting the laws—neath the sound of applause</p>
 
    <p>Prometheus spits even though he’s been gifted with forethought<br>
    He lays down his check and places his bet on the longshot<br>
    He thinks of his life, of his kids and his wife and the onslaught<br>
    Of debts he can’t drown—maybe it’ll all turn around <br>
    Look out there, on the tide<br>
        Ain’t the grass always greener on the sea’s other side?<br>
        But to get there don’t you gotta ride<br>
        Through a horizon of flames— </p>
 
    <p>And as your dreams slowly break apart<br>
        And every time you look back you find you’re still at the start <br>
        you don’t see it, but you know, somehow, down in your heart <br>
            that you ain’t quite the same—<br>
    something’s different now, something new you can’t quite explain—<br>
    in spite of yourself, of your goals, and your aims<br>
    you’ve changed</p>
 
    <p>Honey I’ve tried all these rules to abide, but I’m failing<br>
    I was hoping to skip getting stuck on this ship but it’s sailing<br>
    If it springs a leak I’ll be tempted to leap—oer the railing<br>
    swim for the shore—til I can’t swim anymore—</p>
 
    <p>Coyotes dance while the wind in the branch is still blowing<br>
    Out in the fields the summertime yields unto snowing<br>
    Don’t know what I’ll find but I’ve made up my mind and I’m going<br>
    On up ahead—just like I said<br>
        don’t feed me that old blue line<br>
        If I have a say in the matter there won’t be a next time <br>
        I know maybe you don’t mind—<br>
            But I won’t stand for the pain</p>
 
    <p>You didn’t see me see you blush<br>
        But you gotta lay down your cards when they’re callin your bluff<br>
        And God help you if you don’t have the stuff<br>
            to go on or maintain<br>
        you gotta play by the dealer’s rules or get out of the game<br>
        if you don’t know it by now, you will when you set foot on that train— <br>
        you’ve changed     </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales1_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>As I was riding down the road / of a country strange, homeward bound<br>
    A gust of wind rose from the east / and knocked me sprawling to the ground<br>
    My horse, tho startled, didn’t fall / he only reared and neighed and fled<br>
    I called his name but he’d gone too far / I was stranded, helpless, left for dead</p>
 
    <p>In the muddied ditch I lay awhile / from consciousness I came and went<br>
    Until I startled at the sound / of a drunken carriageman’s lament<br>
    He’d only stopped to rest his horse / and permit an overdue relief<br>
    I scared him nearly half to death / when I begged for him to “Help me—please!”</p>
 
    <p>He hoisted me into his ride / two passengers already were aboard<br>
    a prospector heading for his mine, and a Lady going to meet her Lord<br>
    they took me in and nursed my wounds / from a scarf the Lady fashioned me a sling<br>
    they asked to know from whence I came / but I couldn’t remember anything</p>
 
    <p>we drove all night until the dawn / by sun-up we had made the town<br>
    the driver stopped at the Blue Hotel / told the concierge to bring the doctor down<br>
    the doctor was a shiftless man / he smelled of whiskey something fierce<br>
    his arms were bare but for tattoos / his ears and lips and nose were pierced</p>
 
    <p>he carried me up to his room and gave me something for the pain<br>
    I passed out almost immediately / when I awoke, we were on the move again<br>
    This time it was a different scene / I’s in a box-car bound and gagged<br>
    The conductor, through his surgeon’s mask, / gave me a morsel and said it was all he had</p>
 
    <p>At the station we were shuffled off / some people had already died<br>
    Another carriage found me there / I’s ordered to “Hurry! Get inside!”<br>
    I was taken to a large estate / where I served a man of much esteem<br>
    Eventually I earned his trust / and learned to interpret all his dreams</p>
 
    <p>He found my skills so excellent, he decided I should meet the king<br>
    And when the king looked on my face, he burst into tears, remembering<br>
    He said I was his long-lost son, finally at last come home again <br>
    He said, My horse arrived years before—they figured I’d been robbed and slain!</p>
 
    <p>He stripped my siblings of their rites, their inheritance to me conferred<br>
    Introduced me to my fiancé; that same night I married her<br>
    At dawn I rose to walk the grounds and see what memories I could wake<br>
    I found the gardener in his grove, he said I’d made a grave mistake</p>
 
    <p>He said my wife’d forsaken me, and had become his lover since<br>
    he told me that she loved him still, but of that I remained unconvinced<br>
    he challenged me unto a duel and offered me a loaded gun<br>
    we took ten paces from ourselves, turned and fired—he lost, I won</p>
 
    <p>the gunshot roused a sleeping guard / who arrived in time to see the death<br>
    the gardener laid the blame on me / with his dying final breath— <br>
    I fled to my old and ragged horse, a beast unfit to bear a prince— <br>
    a gust of wind rose from the east, which I’ve been chasing ever since…    </p>

    <p>I come from a place somewheres in the East<br>
    But I had to get away and hide<br>
    I set out for the West, and every place I think to rest<br>
    I just get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    I just get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>I always hoped to live with good, upstanding folks<br>
    But their customs I could not abide<br>
    Before I’d push a broom, I’d be ready just as soon<br>
    To get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    Get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>When I asked for advice on how to live a moral life<br>
    They told me: let my conscience be my guide<br>
    Whenever trouble comes, I’m either reaching for my gun<br>
    Else I get back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    Get back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I came into a town where a crowd had gathered round<br>
    A wanted poster that said “Dead or Alive!”<br>
    Well anybody there could see the fella looked a lot like me<br>
    So I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I rode into a town that was crawling with police<br>
    They’s in every place I looked inside<br>
    Rather than try my luck, riskin getting stuck,<br>
    I just got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I just got back on my horse to ride </p>
 
    <p>I rode into a place just as a church was letting out<br>
    To the priest I went in to confide<br>
    “My son you cannot win,” he said, “Turn your poor self in!”<br>
    So I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I’ve tried out all the sins that can damn a man to hell<br>
    And the worst of all the sins is pride<br>
    If I’m bound for hell, I suppose I might as well<br>
    Just get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    I just get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>I came upon a man who was hanging on a cross<br>
    A sharpened spear had pierced his side<br>
    There was no one else around, so I cut that fellow down<br>
    Then I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    Got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I come into a bar where some men was playing cards<br>
    “You in?” they asked, “I’m in,” I replied<br>
    Fore they knew what I’s about, I cleaned them fellas out<br>
    Then I got back on my horse to ride, ride, ride<br>
    I got back on my horse to ride</p>
 
    <p>I once knew a man who lived on others’ trust<br>
    Borrowed from far and wide<br>
    “What you gonna do when your first payment is due?”<br>
    Gonna get back on my horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    Gonna get back on my horse and ride</p>
 
    <p>They say that only love can break your heart<br>
    And know it’s true, cause I tried <br>
    But when you feel it’s through, the only thing to do<br>
    Is to get back on that horse and ride, ride, ride<br>
    Is get back on that horse and ride    </p>

    <p>Went to see my doctor and he’s looking at my file<br>
“Your vaccines have expired, friend,” he tells me with a smirk<br>
He asks me, “How long’s it been?” I say, “I guess it’s been a while,”<br>
Then he tells me he’ll be right back—“why don’t you go remove your shirt?”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
As I ever was, as I’ll ever get<br>
I’m ready now as I’ll ever hope to ever be again<br>
Good or bad or just okay<br>
I’m ready for it either way<br>
So come on—hurry up—alright already—give it to me, then! </p>
 
    <p>Rose was in her senior year when I started at her school<br>
Her boyfriend, Joe, was captain of two athletic teams <br>
She was nothing like me, she was popular and cool— <br>
the most beautiful woman my young eyes had ever seen</p>
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>I took my darling out to eat the evening before last<br>
To celebrate our five year dating anniversary<br>
I was wondering how her day went and was just about to ask<br>
When she said, “If you’re going to propose, you’d better get down on one knee,” </p>
 
    <p>And told her so, at which point she excused herself to cry—<br>
While she was gone the waitress slipped me her old wedding-band<br>
Said, “I don’t need this anymore, why don’t you give it a try?”</p>
 
 
 
 
    <p>The night before our wedding my fiancé and I<br>
Got into a fight so bad we thought the plug was pulled<br>
She left the rehearsal without so much as goodbye<br>
I thought it just as well—my feet were getting plenty cold</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>Well I came into some money so I thought of buying up a home<br>
Scoured the whole city, found one place I could afford<br>
I put the offer in soon as the bank approved my loan<br>
But the owner’d already promised it to some millionaire landlord</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>Well I went to see an old friend on the night before he died<br>
He’d been diagnosed with cancer and wasn’t looking at all well<br>
He’d just turned ninety-seven was paralyzed all down one side<br>
Said “I wish someone would have the courage to help me get out of this hell…</p>

    <h2>Good Evening, Reverend</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Unravelled Tales - Volume 2, 2021</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Good evening, Reverend—I see you’ve kept your promise, then<br>
    You said you’d visit me—right up until the very end<br>
    I hope you haven’t come to try once more to save my soul<br>
    At dawn’s awakening, I’ll be swinging from the gallowspole </p>
 
    <p>Don’t ask me how I am, if you were me, how would you feel?<br>
    Born on the bottom rung to be blotted out by fortune’s wheel <br>
    I’s never counted-on, or expected to amount to much<br>
    If I’m recalled at all, it’ll be as a no good such-and-such</p>
 
    <p>I never met the girl—her name, I’m told, was Jennifer<br>
    Blessed with gorgeous looks, and fine, upstanding character <br>
    About her qualities, I’ve heard countless people testify<br>
    They called her “innocent”, and say “the innocent don’t deserve to die!” </p>
 
    <p>She told her parents, she and her friends were going out that night<br>
    She told those friends of hers, she was going to meet a boy she liked<br>
    She told the boy she liked, there was some pressing thing that needed done<br>
    They all expected her; she didn’t show for none of em</p>
 
    <p>They found her ravaged corpse discarded in a park nearby<br>
    Police found me there, too, drunk, without an alibi<br>
    She had been drunk as well, and this, they said, was evidence<br>
    The truth, however, is, it only was coincidence</p>
 
    <p>I couldn’t pay the bail; a lawyer, they appointed me<br>
    He couldn’t pronounce my name, but in his defense, he worked for free<br>
    They offered me a deal, said “Confess, and you’ll serve seventy” <br>
    But I refused to lie; they gave me the death penalty</p>
 
    <p>I read your bible through; in here, Lord knows, I’ve had the time<br>
    I paid attention, close, to the passages that you underlined<br>
    I recognized myself when they imprisoned Joseph wrongfully<br>
    And in Job’s lonesome wail, I found I’s in good company </p>
 
    <p>The thing I didn’t get is where it says that Jesus died for me,<br>
    if that’s the case, then, I’d like the guard to set me free<br>
    I know he won’t, though, tho he can quote the scripture, too<br>
    he says, “When God made his plans—tell me, sinner, where were you?”</p>
 
    <p>And you know what the worst part is? The climax of this tragedy—<br>
    That poor girl that was killed—her murderer’s still walking free <br>
    Perhaps he’ll kill again—I’ve prayed for him to, more than once <br>
    So that my death, if not my life, would be counted with the innocents</p>
 
    <p>I know I have to die, it’s something everyone must do<br>
    There ain’t a man alive who isn’t only passing through<br>
    The only difference, though, is that my appointment’s registered<br>
    On the warden’s calendar, 8:00a.m., October 3rd</p>
 
    <p>Don’t feel you have to talk, I can see you’d like to comfort me<br>
    To practice what you’ve learned in your school of the divinities<br>
    If all the plans are laid, then what’s the sense in groveling? <br>
    If you’d like to help me now, you can do the following:</p>
 
    <p>Tell my doctor there’s no need to send more medicine<br>
    Tell my debtors that I already have forgiven them<br>
    Tell my disciples my death is no martyrdom<br>
    Tell my country I wish I could have been its citizen</p>
 
    <p>Remind the Christians that Jesus was an only son<br>
    Ask the judges to consider where their power’s from<br>
    Tell my story often, and when you do, please say “unless something’s done<br>
    That this man’s tragic fate could be the same for you or anyone”</p>
 
    <p>Tell your followers if they want to win they’ll have to fight<br>
    Tell the lawyers—calling it their job won’t make it right <br>
    Tell your escort when you leave to please turn off the light—<br>
    Good evening, reverend—I hope you will sleep well tonight    </p>

    <p>Well the whistle is blowin in the factry, says the time for quittin’s almost come<br>
    Everybody all at once they say exactly just what they will do when they are done<br>
    Some say that they are goin drinkin, some say that they will join them for a few<br>
    Some just stand around like they are thinking, till someone asks them, “How bout you?”<br>
        I say, goodnight you workers and you dreamers<br>
        And those of you less tired than you thought<br>
        We’ll all get back to working in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I walked down to the corner of the b-line, just like I always do to catch the bus<br>
    Some women asked me if I’d like to have a good time, said, cause if you do, just come with us<br>
    I told them I was grateful for the invite, told them any other night I normally would<br>
    But as the bus had caught us in its headlight, I apologized and hoped they understood<br>
        I said, Goodnight all you well-wishing ladies<br>
        And to all the good-times you might’ve brought<br>
        We’ll all get back to lovin in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I rode the bus to where I normally go, half way there I must’ve fell asleep<br>
    When I woke up I was in the depot, and I couldn’t find my wallet or my keys<br>
    I figured that somebody’d gone and robbed me and I ran into the street to find a cop<br>
    I found and asked him if he could help me, he said, “Actually, to be honest, probably not,”<br>
        So I said, Goodnight you coppers and you robbers<br>
        And you bandits who’ve stolen all you’ve got<br>
        We’ll get back to our disputing in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I took to my heels and I started walking, as home was still a good few miles away<br>
    But I ran into a friend and we got to talkin, pulled me into the saloon and said he’d pay<br>
    Inside they had a jukebox goin, and every face was one I seemed to know<br>
    The whiskey like a river it was flowing, till at 4am the tender said twas time to go<br>
        So I said, goodnight you drunkards and you boozehounds<br>
        Goodnight steve and phil and chuck and bob<br>
        We’ll get back to drinkin in the morning<br>
        But tonight I’m gonna sleep like it’s my job</p>
 
    <p>Well I made it home just as the dawn was breaking, I felt like I had never been so beat<br>
    Every muscle in my body, it was achin, I could barely even stand to keep my feet<br>
    I climbed into my bedroom through my window, took off my shoes and pants and socks and shirt<br>
    I eased my body down into my pillow, fell asleep right just in time to go to work<br>
        So I said, Goodnight peaceful easy livin<br>
        Goodnight goodnight’s rest I never got<br>
        Tell those friends of mine, oh, if you see em<br>
        Tell em that I told you—thanks a lot!    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The heavy rain it falls in sheets<br>
    On empty cobbled lamplit streets<br>
    Through which a desperate man retreats<br>
        Hoping to receive the thing he’s paid for<br>
    Beneath the tower clock he waits<br>
    Upon his deeds he ruminates<br>
    He means to flee but hesitates<br>
        Trying to remember what he came for<br>
            With bloody hands he holds the rain<br>
            But whether his or someone else’s pain<br>
            He feels now passing slowly from his heart into his brain<br>
                There is no guessin</p>
 
    <p>A shape from out the shadow shows<br>
    That looks to be like one of those<br>
    He’s seen before and thinks he knows<br>
        If only for the wryness of the smile<br>
    It asks him: has the thing been done<br>
    He throws the shadow back its gun<br>
    With all the bullets there but one<br>
    That was used to kill the meantime for a while<br>
        The darkness as he begins to go<br>
        Says: but what about the pay I owe?<br>
        Don’t you want to hear me say what by now you must already know?<br>
            Or are we even?</p>
 
    <p>You run from justice and you run from strife<br>
    You’re tired of your ransomed life<br>
    Like Abraham you lift your knife<br>
        Obeying the commands that are provided<br>
    You’d like to be somebody else<br>
    You’d like to do things for yourself<br>
    For consolation you can keep your health<br>
    And hope the grieving soon will have subsided<br>
        You believe in everything you’re told<br>
        I’ve done so much worse for less than gold<br>
        But tell me for what price have you gone away and sold<br>
            What I gave unto ya?</p>
 
    <p>The portraits of the patriarchs<br>
    Went overboard to feed the sharks<br>
    You can hear the dog who cries and barks<br>
    Calling for the master who’s abused him<br>
    The soldiers sleep in tents in yards<br>
    While the wounded nurse removes the shards<br>
    Of razorblade behind her heart<br>
        That got there who knows how or for what reason<br>
            You’ve travelled on the beaten path<br>
            As men before and men since have<br>
            And you say some day we’ll both look back on this and laugh<br>
                To keep from cryin</p>
 
    <p>The swallower of swords has said<br>
    What doesn’t kill you will leave you dead<br>
    Worship your heart and you’ll lose your head<br>
        This is the only law you can get by on<br>
    I ain’t the devil and I sure ain’t God<br>
    But right now I’m all you’ve got<br>
    So you can quit me or take your best shot<br>
        Either way you can’t go back to where you came from<br>
            You lent to me your traitor’s kiss<br>
            Yes, and they’ll make you a man for this<br>
            Tell me when I’m gone do you suppose you’ll miss<br>
                Your old companion?</p>
 
    <p>The dice are rolled, the lot’s been cast<br>
    You’ll take the present with the past<br>
    The future’s not what comes at last<br>
        The future’s what precedes the end of knowing<br>
    The detectives organized the clues<br>
    The fingerprints and the bloody shoes<br>
    All the stupid words we used<br>
        Trying not to get where we were going<br>
            I know you knew it all along<br>
            In the name of God, what took so long?<br>
            For you to out and say that you’ve been wrong<br>
                From the beginning?</p>
 
    <p>A story may have many sides<br>
    An individual several lives<br>
    But all were killed and one survives<br>
        And I alone am he that’s left to tell it<br>
    So gentlemen and ladies, here<br>
    Of the jury, court, and everywhere<br>
    Bring your witness now to bear<br>
        Wherever the prosecution seeks to rest it<br>
            And the next time that they come for you<br>
            Be sure to tell them what to do<br>
            You thought you laid it out and saw it through<br>
                But you were mistaken<br>
    The fires in the hearths are low<br>
    The winter never means to snow<br>
    The wind it never tries to blow<br>
        But these things all must have their explanations<br>
    Inside the darkened mouths of thieves<br>
    Are rotten teeth and mustard seeds<br>
    Tongues that keep the truth diseased<br>
        And knowledge well contained by reservations<br>
            And know before they aim and shoot<br>
            You never loved me, you just followed suit<br>
            Your eyes were only ever set upon the loot<br>
                Of which there is none    </p>

    <h2>The Boomerang Song</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Unravelled Tales - Volume 2, 2021</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Once upon a long-lost time<br>
    I knew a girl so fair and fine<br>
    We met at a circus where I’d gone to see a show<br>
    She was swinging from a big trapeze<br>
    Dangling from her bended knee<br>
    From so high up it seemed that down was the only place to go<br>
        Suddenly a cymbal rang<br>
        She pulled out a wooden boomerang<br>
        Threw it hard and watched it circle all around the place<br>
    She caught it in her teeth and smiled<br>
    The audience was a goin wild<br>
    In my heart a feelin came I had to give it chase</p>
 
    <p>Well after I had seen her act<br>
    I couldn’t help a goin back<br>
    I watched her every evening for two whole solid weeks<br>
    The ticketman he learned my name<br>
    When he saw me, he’d say “You, again?”<br>
    Til finally he offered me the chance with her to speak<br>
        My opportunity came at last<br>
        My heart it was a goin fast<br>
        It was after her finale as he was countin up his stubs<br>
    He took me to her trailer car<br>
    Knocked and said, “Well, there y’are,”<br>
    She answered in her bathrobe and she asked me who I was</p>
 
    <p>(alternate)<br>
    I met her in an open field<br>
    Her name as yet, was unrevealed<br>
    But her eyes, they spoke in volumes and her manners, they were kind<br>
    She told me of her heritage<br>
    While I explained how rare it is <br>
    For any lonesome person a sympathetic soul to find<br>
        Suddenly it began to rain<br>
        She pulled out a wooden boomerang<br>
        Threw it hard and watched it sailing whooshing through the air<br>
    The lightning struck at it and missed<br>
    She caught it, said, “Now make a wish”<br>
    I said I wished where she was going that I might follow there</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
        and in a sort of funny way<br>
        you might just go ahead and say<br>
        that I’m a little like that old boomerang you threw<br>
        I make like I’m a gonna go<br>
        And then I do, and fore you know<br>
        Before I’ve gotten anywhere, I’m just a comin back to you</p>
 
    <p>Her hair was long her eyes were dark<br>
    Had a face just like a questionmark<br>
    For a time seemed like she only wanted to be rid of me<br>
    But I behaved a gentleman,<br>
    Fore too long we was like old friends<br>
    Who havn’t got agendas or any special place to be<br>
        We talked until the sun did rise<br>
        Morning took us by surprise<br>
        Her manager came by said it was time for getting on<br>
    She said I guess this means goodbye<br>
    She hung her head and began to cry<br>
    I told her if she’d let me, I’d be glad to come along</p>
 
    <p>I followed her from pennsylvane<br>
    From Portland, Oregon to Portland maine<br>
    Through the plains of Kansas to the scrapers of New York<br>
    a couple times I took the lead<br>
    we quarreled, fought, and disagreed<br>
    and every path we picked just brought us to another fork<br>
        so finally we parted ways<br>
        somewhere round the frisco bays<br>
        she went towards seattle and I to Tennessee<br>
    half way there I lost my horse<br>
    caught a driver headed west and north<br>
    who said, “This time tomorrow, Seattle’s where I’ll be,”</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>The next night I was in her town<br>
    Askin for her all around<br>
    Found a captain who had seen her hangin round the railroad track<br>
    I found her huddled round a blaze<br>
    Tellin stories of the hell we’d raised<br>
    Somebody asked about her partner and if he was comin back?<br>
        At this point I was well disguised <br>
        Had my hat pulled low down oer my eyes<br>
        She said, “if I never see his face again, it’ll be too soon”<br>
    She was smiling when she said it tho<br>
    I could see it in the fire-glow<br>
    And when she was through insulting me, she took me to her room</p>
 
    <p>Next morning, at the break of dawn<br>
    I awoke and found her gone<br>
    The note upon the doorknob said “please shut me when you leave”<br>
    Half-naked, I came down the stairs<br>
    An old lady screamed and said, “Who’s there?”<br>
    When I said “It’s only me,” she said, “I’m calling the police,”<br>
        Well I busted right on out the back<br>
        Never thought twice about looking back <br>
        The thought to hang around awhile did not to me occur<br>
    I ran down to the rail depot<br>
    I hopped a train that was movin slow<br>
    And was trying to catch my breath when I caught a glimpse of her</p>

    <h2>Justice And the Law</h2>

    <p>“Someone’s stolen my property!” the store owner did declare<br>
    Policeman turned the corner, found me standin there</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS:<br>
            In the next world you’ll get justice; in this world you get the law</p>
 
    <p>I said I didn’t do it, I said it wasn’t me<br>
    He put me into his handcuffs and threw away the key<br>
    Took me down to county, held me there all night<br>
    Wanted my confession, I said, “I know my rights!”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>They brought me in a lawyer, must’ve come straight from the bar,<br>
    He said, “You don’t have to use me, but if you don’t, you won’t get far,”<br>
    he said, “Why don’t you give up? It’s your only move! <br>
    the truth is not important if it’s nothin you can prove” <br>
        chorus </p>
 
    <p>we went before the judge and he said I’d been accused<br>
    of murder in the first degree, I said, “I think you’re confused!”<br>
    the judge he asked the lawyer, “How does the defendant plead?”<br>
    “Your honor,” he said “Guilty—of murder in the first degree!”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>They gave me twenty years to life with no chance of parole<br>
    Judge said, “May the Lord God have mercy on your soul”<br>
    They took me away from my family, took me away from my home<br>
    Threw me into the lockdown and left me all alone<br>
        chorus </p>
 
    <p>my wife she tried to stand by me, she protested and made waves<br>
    she had to quit the fight tho, she had two kids to raise<br>
    so I wrote a million letters, and my appeal date finally came<br>
    I tried a different strategy, but the outcome was the same<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>the officer who arrested me will be Commissioner any day<br>
    my old lawyer’s on the ballot to take the seat of the D.A.<br>
    the judge, he ran for office, history turned the page<br>
    now he’s livin in a big old mansion with a girlfriend his daughter’s age <br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>our justice system’s overwrought; it’s just stopped making sense<br>
    what good’s the law to anyone if can’t protect innocence?<br>
    If I had to describe it in a word or two or less <br>
    I’d say the American Incarceral State’s downright Kafkaesque<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Pilate said to Jesus, “If you’re his son, let God save you,”<br>
    Jesus said, “Forgive them, father, they don’t know what they do.”<br>
    The preacher here in prison he says “the truth will set you free—”<br>
    But to hell with his truth, it hasn’t done a thing for me <br>
        It don’t matter where it comes, it don’t matter how<br>
        The Law’s done nothing for me, I’m after justice now!     </p>

    <p>The fire marshall, on vacation / called his boys for information<br>
    But they weren’t at the station / They were nowhere to be found<br>
    And the papers didn’t mention / the gasoline the place was drenched in<br>
    between the garage and the engine / burning slowly to the ground<br>
        And here I am again to say<br>
    Here I am—just yesterday<br>
        Here I am—nearly spent<br>
        Here I am—a child, and reticent  to grow into my sorrow</p>
 
    <p>The prophesy was written / Abraham bore many children<br>
    then he went ahead and killed them / At the instruction of the Lord<br>
    and so Isaac wrote to Ishmael / who thought the letter was just junkmail<br>
    Live by the pen to die, still / at the destruction of the sword<br>
        Here I am, still getting by<br>
        Here I am—to make another try <br>
        Here I am—barely awake<br>
        Here I am, reluctant to ever take</p>
 
    <p>the criminal outfoxes the mandatory little boxes<br>
    as he gives a brief synopsis of his life up until now<br>
    Telling who and when and wherefore, and other things he’s been prepared for<br>
    implicating others, therefore, without ever saying how<br>
        here I am, on the run<br>
        here I am—t’bring what I’ve begun<br>
        here I am, alone at last<br>
        here I am—but will the past</p>
 
    <p>Now I’m sitting at the keyboard / trying to guess at my own password<br>
    The keystroke of the four-chord / sounding nothing like your name<br>
    While the bells in the cathedral / so archaic and medieval<br>
    Announce at evening that the weasel’s / brought the monkey to the game<br>
        And here I am, still hanging on<br>
        Here I am—waitin for the dawn<br>
        And here I am—not getting through<br>
        Here I am—like superglue</p>
 
    <p>And there’s nothing left to wonder / to take or steal or plunder<br>
    You’ve succumbed, and now you’re under / neath the sorceress’s spell<br>
    meanwhile somewhere music’s playing / and some listener’s obeying<br>
    A recorded voice that’s saying: “please return now to your cell”<br>
        And here I am, still on the ground<br>
        Here I am—tho try, by leap or bound<br>
        And here I am—the solitaire<br>
        Here I am—it’s not been fun or fair</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Went in to work first thing this morning<br>
    First thing that happens, with no kind of warning<br>
    My boss comes up lookin kind of fraught<br>
    says he wants to see me today in his office at three o’clock <br>
        Am I fired?<br>
        I wondered </p>
 
    <p>Well I figure it’s curtains for me, I guess<br>
    So I took the liberty of cleanin out my desk<br>
    At 3pm I’m outside his door<br>
    With a few other folks who work on my floor<br>
        We give a knock<br>
        The door opens…</p>
 
    <p>Inside there’s this crowd of people huddlin<br>
    In front of em’s our boss, he’s explaining something<br>
    He says, “…now I don’t want to hear no more of your complaining<br>
    We’re going to sit through this active shooter training—<br>
        And you’re gonna like it!<br>
        Might even learn something—!</p>
 
    <p>He introduces the keynote speaker<br>
    This fella dressed in Kevlar from helmet to sneaker<br>
    He’s a retired cop and an ex-marine<br>
    Says he’s here to tell us about some of what he’s seen<br>
        In the line of duty<br>
        The field of battle</p>
 
    <p>He says, “I was in Colorado in ‘99<br>
    When the call came through from Columbine;<br>
    few years later they had me take a look<br>
    at what went wrong at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook<br>
        that church in Charleston<br>
        and the Orlando Night-club…”</p>
 
    <p>He says, “Nowadays you can’t be too prepared<br>
    A mass shooting can happen most anywhere:<br>
    In churches, synagogues, concert halls,<br>
    Schools, playgrounds, dance-clubs, malls<br>
        They’re happening wherever there’s people gathering, really<br>
        The more the scarier</p>
 
 
 
 
 
    <p>He says “I wish I could give you a rule of thumb<br>
    But the truth is, an active shooter can look like anyone<br>
    They can be young, middle-aged, elderly<br>
    They can look like you or you or—even me!<br>
        Then he grins real big<br>
        Pulls out his pistol</p>
 
    <p>He says, “I ain’t your boss, but if it were up to me<br>
    You can bet it’d be mandatory<br>
    Everybody in here would own a gun<br>
    And would be well trained in how to go about using one<br>
        Says he’s got one in every room of his house<br>
        Keeps a loaded one under his pillow</p>
 
    <p>He said, “In schools now they’re given guns to teachers<br>
    In churches they’re giving guns to preachers<br>
    If it were up to me and I could get my say<br>
    Every red-blooded one of you’d join the NRA<br>
         And he pulls out his membership card<br>
        And an armload of pamphlets</p>
 
    <p>About here he pauses and says, “Are there any questions?<br>
    Comments? Insights? Thoughts? Suggestions?”<br>
    There’s something I couldn’t quite understand<br>
    So I waited a minute, put up my hand<br>
        He says, “You there! Scrawny guy!<br>
    Shoot!”</p>
 
    <p>I said “I’m sorry if I find this a bit confusin<br>
    but if guns are the problem, then shouldn’t the solution—”<br>
    He cuts me off like he’s all offended<br>
    Starts reciting the second amendment<br>
        Says: who ever said guns was the problem?<br>
        Guns don’t kill people—crazy people do!</p>
 
    <p>I asked if he could define his terms a little<br>
    The nation’s full of crazy people<br>
    I’m no scholar but to me it seems<br>
    it’d be harder to kill people if they didn’t have the means<br>
        He said now you’re talkin crazy</p>
 
    <p>In America you’re free to buy a gun<br>
    Go outside and shoot someone<br>
    If you’re wealthy, white and affluent<br>
    You can claim you did it in self-defense<br>
        You’ll get away with murder, <br>
    if you’re a officer—</p>
 
    <p>You don’t have to take em all away<br>
    but to make a few more of em illegal might be okay<br>
    I mean, does anyone need an automatic weapon<br>
    for target practice, deer and rabbit huntin?<br>
        Shootin pop bottles off a picket fence? </p>
 
    <p>And maybe we’d not need so much gun protection<br>
    If the manufacturers didn’t make it so easy to get em<br>
    And maybe there’d be effective legislative solutions<br>
    If politicians’d quit taking NRA campaign contributions<br>
        Hell, I don’t know<br>
    It’s just a thought…    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#unravelledTales2_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>A borrowed suit emerging from a rented limousine<br>
    At an empty filling station, a mile from the red car-pet—<br>
    The tank now overflowing, covers him in gasoline<br>
    He takes a step back to ignite himself one final cigarette<br>
        And while they pray and pray—even as the angels sing<br>
        Their eyes they stray, when their miracle appears— <br>
        Someplace else maybe you’d think to call it interesting<br>
        But o, you know it’s just another day round here</p>
 
    <p>The girlfriend of the governor finally made it to his place<br>
    When he got there, she was laughing with his wife who had made tea<br>
    As a curious expression made its way onto his face<br>
    She calmly said, “It’s a funny thing your wife here was telling me,” <br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>At the meeting of the generals they’ve begun gambling with souls<br>
    Disputing lines they’ve scribbled on a map that’s poorly drawn<br>
    The leaders of large countries endorsing things they won’t divulge<br>
    Til someone blows the whistle and turns the war back on<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Running rampant in the castle’s vacant halls<br>
    The ghost of Hamlet dancing with a goblet of champagne<br>
    Candlepin bowling with the madame’s crystal ball<br>
    Shouting slander from the parapet, prophesying rain<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Flotsam floating in the mind’s discrete mirage<br>
    Reveals a keepsake stolen from a bookcase that was a door<br>
    Later it will turn up in some framed-criminal’s garage<br>
    Who will turn it over, saying, “I’ve never seen that thing before—”<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Inside the Zone there are still many places you can’t go<br>
    “There’s too much radiation” read the signs in foreign words<br>
    You could build a mighty fortress with all the things you’ll never know<br>
    If you hadn’t written off impossibles as being for the birds<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>the city hides an alley where a man holds out a cup<br>
    he rings a bell on Christmas Eve, dressed as Santa Claus<br>
    he’s dying and he knows it but he can’t seem to give up<br>
    the thought that someone will take pity and give unto his cause<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>the hero from his armchair gazes at the frozen scene<br>
    a painting he was given for his bravery in the war<br>
    in the quiet of the lamplight he still hears the dead marines<br>
    while his wife in the nursery shouts, “I can’t take this anymore—”<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>stamping passports at the entrance of the gate<br>
    an official’s asking everyone the purpose of their trip:<br>
    a man who’s fleeing circumstance, leaving home because of hate <br>
    is told: I’m sorry, sir, your answer doesn’t seem to fit<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Jesus on the cross cried out “Why has thou Forsaken me?<br>
    Did I not accomplish everything that you desired?”<br>
    God said nothing but someone shouted pityingly,<br>
    “hey man don’t you realize you’ve just been preaching to the choir?”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>The asylum after midnight is an escalating plot:<br>
    A wheelchair has gone missing and a patient can’t be found<br>
    Someone’s dumped the medication in the nurse’s coffee pot<br>
    Any minute now the fire-alarm is probably going to sound<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>the tax-man’s come to gather up the store-owner’s receipts<br>
    but he’s out collecting mercy from the parson, for his soul <br>
    while the barber’s window takes a brick thrown in by the police<br>
    the farmer’s out to pasture, being gored by his own bull<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>America the beautiful for all your amber waves of grain<br>
    for instituting freedom with a rifle and a cage<br>
    For perfect mountain majesties above the fruited plain<br>
    For corruption, waste, hypocrisy, insanity and rage<br>
        chorus    </p>

    On Broad St, Philadelphia PA<br>
    I’m half-dead where I’m standing but I’m trine to look alive<br>
    I tell myself, “You never know, today might be the day—” <br>
    They burst in all disheveled with their hopes out on a limb<br>
    Every one of them surviving on a prayer<br>
    They can all tell you the story about their big ship coming in<br>
    But you’ve already seen the harbor, and you know it isn’t there—<br>
        Lord knows, I hate to be the bearer of bad news <br>
        But I’m afraid you’re out of luck again, today—<br>

    <p>Mr. Pomerantz on food-stamps he got robbed again last night<br>
    While sleeping in the threshold of a shop<br>
    He was thrown out of the shelter for starting up a fight<br>
    Though in his mind he was only trying to make the violence stop;<br>
    He’s waiting on a new card coming from the CAO<br>
    When it gets here it will mean that he can eat;<br>
    Til then he’ll be on exit ramps panhandling for dough<br>
    Shakin his empty coffee-can at strangers on the street<br>
        Lord knows I hate to be the bearer of bad news<br>
        To knock the wind from right out of a sail—<br>

    <p>Jane Finnegan is in again, still going on about<br>
    How her folks are sending money from the farm<br>
    They think she’s still in college, don’t know yet that she dropped out<br>
    And took up a nasty habit that’s puttin holes into her arm<br>
    She’s been in and out of detox, says she’s trying to get clean<br>
    She can’t say it without drawing up a tear<br>
    she says, “Soon as I get that money, I’ll buy a ticket for the train—<br>
    to anywhere, I don’t care, long as it’s far away from here—”<br>
        Lord knows I hate to be the bearer of bad news<br>

        I wish I could tell her something that could cure her blues…<br>

    He looks tired and he says his feet are sore<br>
    The guards released him sometime early morning yesterday <br>
    But his clothes, wallet and money all got sent out the day before—<br>
    He’s in need of food, employment, and most of all, some place to stay<br>
    His PO thinks he’s got somewhere to be<br>
    Three months ago he got word his grandmother passed away<br>
    She was his only living family, his only chance at staying free—<br>
        Lord knows I hate to be the bearer of bad news<br>
        To see a man caught tween a graveyard and a jail<br>
        I wish I could relieve him of what he’s been accused<br>

    Where he went he said, to “be all he could be”<br>
    One night he found a landmine planted by the Taliban<br>

    He’s got a letter from the VA, says they couldn’t save his house<br>
    Tho they appealed his case to eleven different banks<br>

    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 1</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Hey, babe—will you step out of that shadow<br>
    Will you open up your window?<br>
        I’m down here in the rain<br>
        Throwin pebbles from the drain<br>
        And I gotta say my aim—it ain’t so good<br>
    Hey babe, will you just listen for a second<br>
    I know you haven’t called or beckoned me<br>
        I came of my own free will<br>
        At the risk of falling ill<br>
        To see if you were still up and in this neighborhood</p>
 
    <p>But it was only the errand of a fool, I see<br>
        Like you were waiting up for someone, and that someone wasn’t me</p>
 
    <p>Hey, babe—I can tell that you been crying<br>
    You say you weren’t but you’re just lyin, now<br>
        You got water on your dress<br>
        And I don’t mean to press<br>
        But how do you suggest that I think otherwise?<br>
    Hey, babe—you don’t have to act so perfect<br>
    You can’t be blamed for every serpent tongue<br>
        That slithers down to ask<br>
        While you’re walkin your own path<br>
        Whether something from your past has gone unrecognized</p>
 
    <p>But it’s only the remnant of a dream, I’m sure<br>
        Like recollections of a place you feel you’ve been but never were</p>
 
    <p>Hey, babe—are you alright, you look a little<br>
    Like you been cut right through the middle<br>
        Like your mind’s been sawn in two <br>
        And you don’t know what to do<br>
        But your sure it can’t be you there in the bathroom meer<br>
    Hey, babe—won’t you tell me what’s the trouble<br>
    You spelled it out but much too subtly<br>
        I’ve never been to sharp<br>
        And you got me in the dark<br>
        And I think I missed the mark you left somewhere round here</p>
 
    <p>But it’s only a hieroglyphic drawn in sand<br>
        Even if I could perceive it I’m sure I still wouldn’t understand</p>
 
    <p>Hey, babe—can I just say that I’m sorry<br>
    If I hurt you with my story<br>
        You know I never meant<br>
        For it to go the way it went<br>
        The impression that I’m lent is that it left you sore<br>
    Hey, babe—I don’t need you to say nothing<br>
    Words are cheap, a dime a dozen<br>
        I give em out for free<br>
        And they just come back to me<br>
        Likes waves upon the sea crashing on the shore    </p>

    <h2>Next Best Thing</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 2</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>When you’re all through lookin for prince charming<br>
    Who’s no more than a wolf in sheep’s clothes<br>
    When you’ve tried on all the glass slippers<br>
    And not one has left room for your toes</p>
 
    <p>When you’re tired of putting up posters<br>
    Advertisements, pictures and flyers<br>
    When you’ve reviewed each application<br>
    And there’s a good deal left to be desired</p>
 
    <p>I’ll be right here waiting<br>
        You don’t have to explain a thing<br>
        I’m plain as they come—no one’s number one<br>
        But if you’re lonesome, I’m the next best thing</p>
 
    <p>When you’re tired of keeping a standard<br>
    So high even birds fall quite short<br>
    When you’ve called in all of your favors<br>
    And are desperate for some last resort</p>
 
    <p>When you can’t tell how long you’ve been crying<br>
    Whether anybody out there’s hearing ya<br>
    When you’re ready to throw out the rulebook<br>
    For a new set of criteria</p>
 
    <p>I’ll be right here waiting<br>
        I ain’t gonna bite you or sting<br>
        It’s no big surprise—I’m nobody’s prize<br>
        But if you’re lonesome, I’m the next best thing</p>
 
    <p>When your heart can’t take any more teasing<br>
    And your tongue just can’t tell one more lie<br>
    And the size of your sorrow’s increasing<br>
    And each breath you breathe’s just a sigh</p>
 
    <p>When you’re twisted from all of the pressure<br>
    That’s on you to find someone to love<br>
    Which you don’t even know how to measure<br>
    Short of shrinking neath what you’re above</p>
 
    <p>I’ll be right here waiting<br>
        Off the mainstage in the back of the wing<br>
        I’m not the star of the show—I’m no one’s hero<br>
        But if you’re lonesome I’m the next best thing     </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 3</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>We arrive at the picture show an hour fore it starts<br>
    What I call entertainment you call art<br>
    You always cry at the funniest parts<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You take the high road and I take the low<br>
    When I’m in a hurry you’re movin slow<br>
    I say, “You know what?” and you already know<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You ain’t like other people, you’re a diamond in the rough<br>
    You’re shy in front of strangers, but you act so tough<br>
    You don’t like much attention, you’re very quick to blush<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>The only time you need me’s when your parking meter’s done<br>
    You ask me for a quarter and I give you one<br>
    You rack a hundred dollar ticket cause you give it to a bum<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>Whenever it’s your birthday, you never ask for gifts<br>
    I bring you wine and roses, you say what’s all this?<br>
    You don’t see the sense in celebrating the fact that you exist<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You never do what’s fashionable, you make up your own trends<br>
    If the ladies room is crowded, you just use the men’s <br>
    I don’t understand you sometimes, you don’t make any sense<br>
        That’s why I love you</p>
 
    <p>You never draw outside the lines, you follow all the rules<br>
    When it comes to bein punctual you’re stubborn as a mule<br>
    You’ve never heard of james dean, you think peter lorre’s cool<br>
        That’s why I love you    </p>

    <h2>Closest I Ever Came</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 4</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I’m wounded—some arrow must’ve caught me off guard<br>
    I can’t see my own hand in this place, it’s so dark<br>
    Lady luck must’ve held out to deal me these cards<br>
    In this light, every bull’s eye’s a big questionmark<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I only wanted to feel like I wasn’t insane<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>I’m not one to accomplish whatever I set out to do<br>
    There’s only so much that one person can try<br>
    Using brass-tacks and duct-tape, adhesives and glue<br>
    You can stop all the holes but it don’t mean you can fly<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someway to keep out of the rain<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>Over and over I ask myself: Why?—<br>
    at what point, exactly, did my intentions stray?<br>
        I can’t help but feel, no matter how hard I try<br>
        The whole time, it was only an armslength away </p>
 
    <p>I’ve sought buried treasure using antique maps<br>
    I’ve travelled extensively on the rumor of jewels<br>
    I’ve interviewed strangers, collected their facts<br>
    Withstood the judgment of prophets and fools<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted money, power, fortune and fame—<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>Don’t say it, you don’t have to—I’m goin away<br>
    These words are the last you’ll hear from me for a time<br>
    It gets more confusing the longer I stay<br>
    It’s not working out for you—and that’s fine<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someone who’d take her share of the blame<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>BRIDGE<br>
 
    <p>The search must continue, what can I do but go on?<br>
    I’ll keep movin til I find a new home, I suppose<br>
    Where some lonesome lady’s waiting up for the dawn<br>
    Prayin for respite from all that she knows <br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someone who knew me by my name<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came</p>
 
    <p>Time’s passing—I’m agin—getting older each day<br>
    There’s more to look back on than ahead to by now<br>
    I thought I’d be happy, but what can I say?<br>
    I believed it back then, and always knew it somehow<br>
        I don’t want to keep you if you don’t wish to remain<br>
        Still I wish there were something I could say to explain<br>
        I just wanted someway of easing my pain<br>
        Loving you was the closest that I ever came    </p>

    <h4>Album: <i>Say When, 2021</i> Track 5</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>You still can’t decide if it’s better to hide or to come out wearing your blues<br>
    When push comes to shove you’re able to love just as far as you’re willing to lose<br>
    You’ve poured out your cup but it keeps filling up flowing over again<br>
    As what was collides with what might have been<br>
        What might’ve been if only we’d known<br>
        We might’ve turned round we might’ve come home<br>
        We might’ve grown old, we might’ve been shown<br>
        A way of our own<br>
        Through thick and thin<br>
        And gone it alone<br>
            I just can’t say when</p>
 
    <p>Your foregone concern as you try to relearn how to let go and how to hold on<br>
    Is with whether or not you’ve already forgot how he’s right here now that he’s gone<br>
    The tables’ve turned upon what you discerned to be the difference between you and them<br>
    Without ever once giving up you had to give in<br>
        Had to give in if only to sleep<br>
        Every once in a while, maybe once in a week<br>
        Or once you’ve come back <br>
        From making the leap<br>
        And stopping the leak<br>
        By going all in<br>
        On this losing streak<br>
            I just can’t say when</p>
 
    <p>Your only defense as you try to make sense of this trial you’ve put yourself through<br>
    Is how you’re consoled by your lack of control and you realize it might’ve been you<br>
    You’re trine to accept what you couldn’t expect would be waiting for you on the wind<br>
    He wasn’t my brother by blood but he was my friend<br>
        He was my friend, you told to them all<br>
        As they lent you their ears and let their eyes fall<br>
        And backed away slow<br>
        Saying nothing at all<br>
        Not like I don’t know<br>
        The way it’ll go<br>
        The way that it’s been<br>
        There’ll be tomorrow<br>
            I just can’t say when</p>
 
    <p>The time it moves fast but you cant feel it pass as you sit up and talk with the moon<br>
    This mountain of grief can be moved with belief but all anyone brought is a spoon<br>
    You’re tryin so hard not to let down your guard but now that you know how it ends<br>
    It might as well break wherever it bends<br>
        Right where it bends, before it deserts<br>
        And they ask you to say right where it hurts<br>
        And you show up one morning <br>
        Wearing one of his shirts<br>
        That you pulled from the dirt<br>
        And you tried to convert<br>
        But you just disconcert<br>
        I know that it hurts<br>
        I know where it hurts<br>
        I know how it hurts<br>
        I know why it hurts<br>
            I just can’t say when    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>There’s a feeling in the atmosphere that a storm’s about to break<br>
    The sky’s about as bruised as it could be<br>
    If I don’t tell her how I feel it’ll be my own mistake<br>
    A girl like that won’t wait around for me</p>
 
    <p>The forecast says precipitation’s likely—99%<br>
    I guess that means there’s still a chance it won’t<br>
    But there I go inventing each explanation to prevent<br>
    Me from doing what I ought to if I don’t</p>
 
    <p>Here goes nothing I suppose<br>
        To tell her I love her and show her how<br>
        I been saving for a rainy day—and hey, what do you know? <br>
    It’s raining now</p>
 
    <p>the weatherman’s been drawing crazy circles on his chart<br>
    he says he thinks it’s going to rain on our parade<br>
    is there something I can do to help in case this falls apart<br>
    what was it just now you were going to say?</p>
 
    <p>It started kind of gentle now it’s raining cats and dogs<br>
    I regret that I’m not a little more prepared<br>
    First I’m stranded in the desert, now I’m trapped in the mirage<br>
    It might look to brave to you from out there, but truth be told I’m scared</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I looked out my attic window, it’s still morning but it’s dark<br>
    I feel like I’ve still got a lot to say<br>
    My next-door neighbor, Noah, built himself a little ark<br>
    Awhile ago I watched him sail away</p>
 
    <p>If it weren’t for drought season I’d’ve probably already drowned<br>
    I’m not one who’s been known for making plans<br>
    the survivor in me’s thinking we should head for higher ground<br>
    but the thought of leaving you’s what keeps me standing where I am—</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>she was married when I met her but it was hanging by a thread<br>
    I’d good reason to believe that she’d wanted me instead<br>
    I’ll never know just how the thought ever got into my head—<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I smelled her honeysuckle so I followed where it lead<br>
    A line of fools stood at her door with gifts of wine and bread <br>
    I asked if they had thought to knock, they told me, “Go right ahead,”<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I could’ve swore she did—I could’ve swore she did<br>
        She always was the kind to keep her thoughts under a lid<br>
        If I’d money to wager on, I’d of surely lost the bid<br>
        I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did </p>
 
    <p>I’s admitted to her parlor by a butler in a wig<br>
    I shook hands with her father and he asked me what I did<br>
    I told him off the record that I aimed to make it big<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I spied her on the landing hearing every word I said<br>
    She descended as my face was turning every shade of red<br>
    I asked her out to dinner and she took me straight to bed<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>I could’ve swore she did—I could’ve swore she did<br>
        Every look she gave me said that she was interested<br>
        I’s never one to fall in love, but I tripped and slipped and slid <br>
        I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>Afterwards I watched her as she rolled her cigarette<br>
    then smiled at me mysteriously and told me how I did<br>
    To me the word “tomorrow” sounded like an empty threat<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>She asked me what my name was, where I’d lived and what I’d read<br>
    I told her and she laughed and said, “My God, you’re just a kid!”<br>
    She showed me out the back door, though I begged her and I plead—<br>
    I know she never loved me but I could’ve swore she did</p>
 
    <p>interlude<br>
 
    <p>Along life’s lonesome highway I’ve drifted and I’ve sped<br>
    Love is a thought the likes of which by now I’ve gotten rid<br>
    Alone into this world I’s born, and alone I’ll be when I’m dead<br>
    I know she never loved me, but I could’ve swore she did    </p>

    <p>Once I thought I had you pegged as one of those who knew the world<br>
    You spoke of it so plainly<br>
    Alluded to it in the past-tense mainly<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That you’ve always been uncertain<br>
        About what’s just behind the curtain<br>
        Afraid to name the thing that’s hurtin you so badly<br>
            Funny, I never knew—silly me</p>
 
    <p>Once I thought dreams could come true, anyone could be whatever they put their minds<br>
    Or backs into becoming<br>
    The gun is fired, the racers are off and running<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That it ain’t the dream that drives you<br>
        That determines or decides you<br>
        That undoes and divides you any way it can, you see<br>
            Funny, I thought it was—silly me</p>
 
    <p>Once I thought I found true love awaiting me in the most<br>
    Obvious of places<br>
    Wearing one of its million faces<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That love has its disguises<br>
        As many let-downs as surprises<br>
        And its veteran advises to look only after you leap<br>
            Funny, I didn’t know—silly me</p>
 
    <p>Once I thought I had it bad; I’d taken all the beatings<br>
    That this world had to give me<br>
    I had the scars to show and to carry with me<br>
    But I’ve come a long way since then, and now I know<br>
        That sure the current’s slowin<br>
        But the rivers still strongly flowin<br>
        And no matter how well you’re rowin<br>
        Signs of stopping it ain’t showing<br>
        You know you really had me goin—for a while there it seems<br>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#sayWhen_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>It started out small, well within my control<br>
    Steady as she goes, man, that’s always the goal<br>
    You give it a push, you feel the nudge of a pull<br>
    Suddenly what you’re chasin’s gone and swallowed you whole<br>
        And if you—were me<br>
        I bet you would already know<br>
        Just what to do—to get free<br>
        Of feelin like you got nowhere to go</p>
 
    <p>Chorus:<br>
            At the end of my rope and I got nowhere to fall<br>
            I’m in over my head, I feel kinda small<br>
            Funny, I always thought I was tall<br>
                And ain’t it a drag how hard you can try and it don’t make any </p>
 
    <p>I reached for my hat, she took a hold of my hand<br>
    I bid her goodevening, she did not understand<br>
    She said to speak up, said to say where I stand<br>
    Next thing you know she’s got the whole wedding planned<br>
        And if you were me<br>
        You’d’ve known it, I spose, right from the start<br>
        That what the eyes can see<br>
        Ain’t half of what’s there to be seen by the heart</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>They gave me a job, so we bought a house<br>
    Moved in together, now I sleep on the couch<br>
    I asked someone to pinch me, I said “Ouch,”<br>
    Now I wished I had the sense to put my foot in my mouth<br>
        And if you were me<br>
        Tell me what would be your next move<br>
        Would you stay or leave<br>
        This has moved well beyond any point I may have been trying to prove</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>I travel the world, I see my old friends<br>
    I say it’s been too long, they say how long’s it been<br>
    I tell em the news, they say, Tell It Again<br>
    They say I’ll be find but they don’t ever say when<br>
        And if they only knew<br>
        How hard they can be, sometimes, to please<br>
        Maybe then I could make do<br>
        Without glimpsing a sight of the forest from the trees</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
 
    <p>Rain’s gonna fall, sun’s gonna rise<br>
    Life’s gonna pass you in the blink of an eye<br>
    And whether you’re foolish, whether you’re wise<br>
    It don’t make no difference because everyone dies<br>
        And it’s hard to believe<br>
        That it’s ever gonna happen to me<br>
        I been alive for so long<br>
        I forget that there’s any other way I could be</p>

    If you don’t ask, I won’t give no reason—I won’t take any more than I brought.”<br>
    I told her I’d be there tomorrow, right at the first light of dawn<br>
    But this morning I knocked on her window, her neighbor said she’d already gone<br>
        “Did she leave any note? Did she tell you how come?<br>
        Did she give any good reason why?<br>
        I never had time to explain what I done<br>
        Or got the chance to tell her—goodbye.”</p>
 
    <p>Well I knew she was here on a visit, that she didn’t intend to stay long<br>
    But I remember her now like a music that my whole life’s just been following long<br>
    I recall how she kept at a distance and seemed so reluctant to show<br>
    Any feelin at the mention of lovers whose stories you already know<br>
        Still—I meant to explain the rules of the game<br>
        On the off-chance she intended to fly<br>
        But I never obtained so much as her name<br>
        Or got the chance to tell her goodbye</p>
 
    <p>Now I know that I shouldn’t be jealous of the sly things that other folks do<br>
    There isn’t a brave soul among us in this world who ain’t just passin through<br>
    I know that I’m no less as likely to seem just as vague and aloof<br>
    To shine as dimly or as brightly to any person of comparable youth<br>
        But I just can’t digest the feelin, I guess<br>
        That some people just act much too shy<br>
        I never bestowed any more than hello<br>
        Or got the chance to tell her goodbye    </p>

    <h2>Why Should I Be Kind To My Neighbor</h2>

    <p>In the states we got capitalism,<br>
    Seems to serve some pretty well—<br>
    The rich have the money and power<br>
    Rest of us are going to hell—<br>
    But it’s the same rules governing nature: <br>
    “only the fittest survive”<br>
    But whether you’re fit or a failure<br>
    Seems like everyone wants to know “Why—?</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>
        Why should I be kind to my neighbor? <br>
        Tell me, what’s in it for me?<br>
        Why should I do him a favor? <br>
        When he ain’t done nothing for me? <br>
        There ain’t no money in kindness<br>
        Nobody ever got rich doing good<br>
        You want me to be kind to my neighbor<br>
        Tell me again why I should—</p>
 
    <p>Well the teachers are up in the classrooms<br>
    They’re doing the best that they can<br>
    to keep all their kids out of trouble<br>
    to give every child some sort of plan<br>
    they’re teaching them science and history<br>
    English, geography, math<br>
    but what do they tell to the children<br>
    who put up their hands just to ask:</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>The preachers are up in their pulpits<br>
    They’re tellin everyone to do right<br>
    They say we should all be like Jesus<br>
    They’re tryin to fight the good fight<br>
    They tell all about all the wisdom he shared<br>
    How he lived his whole life without sin—<br>
    How he tried to stand up to the empire…<br>
    But won’t you look at what happened to him—so:</p>
 
    <p>CHORUS<br>
 
    <p>In the states we all got our freedom<br>
    We got our American Dream<br>
    The freedom to say it’s all dandy<br>
    And to pretend things are just as they seem<br>
    But as far as a strong moral compass<br>
    We gave up on that quest long-ago<br>
    Preferring, instead, the old mindset<br>
    that’s hung up on wanting to know:</p>

    <p>Gather round me children and I’ll teach you the way<br>
    You can grow up to be like your role models today<br>
    To talk like a true-blue bona-fide head of state<br>
    If you want to elude any kind of question<br>
    Just pay attention to these here suggestions<br>
    And in no time at all you’ll be able to prevaricate <br>
        You don’t need to believe in no superstition<br>
        To learn to talk like a politician<br>
        All you got to do is look innocently <br>
        At your accusers and say, on three (one, two, three)<br>
            Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t<br>
            Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it isn’t<br>
            Maybe that’s a yes, maybe that’s a big fat no<br>
            When you got no cause, no case, no proof<br>
            Maybe maybe’s the closest you can get to the truth<br>
            Maybe we ought to just let the whole thing go</p>
 
    <p>Adam and eve in the garden of eden<br>
    Were told about a fruit they should refrain from eatin<br>
    God said, “If you ever do, by god it’ll be a sin”<br>
    One day as the good lord was passin on by<br>
    He caught sight of the couple out the corner of his eye<br>
    Wearing clothes behind which they was trine to hide from him<br>
        He called em over said, Adam and eve<br>
        What are you doin wearin them old fig-leaves?<br>
        Who do you spose you are tryin to fool?<br>
        Did you go ahead and break my one and only rule?<br>
            Maybe we did, maybe we didn’t<br>
            Maybe it’s our fault, maybe it isn’t<br>

    <p>Old man Washington had a cherry tree<br>
    Yielded lots of cherries sweet as can be<br>
    His wife used to gather em to make her famous pie<br>
    One day the old man went into town,<br>
    Came back found that old tree chopped down<br>
    The sight brought tears of rage into his tired eyes<br>
        In his loudest voice he called to his only son<br>
        Said, George, get out here—and George, he come<br>
        Said, George, don’t you tell no lie to me<br>
        Was it you who cut down my cherry tree?<br>

    <p>William Clinton was an American president<br>
    Had a reputation that was without precedent<br>
    Swore to protect and serve his country all his life<br>
    One day word broke about some sort of affair<br>
    That gave everybody a little bit of a scare<br>
    He’d been publicly accused of cheating on his wife<br>
        Well they called a meeting, and they called the press<br>
        Tried to make old Bill confess<br>
        Everybody thought they had him caught<br>
        When they said did you have relations with that woman or not?<br>

    <h2>Easier Said Than Done</h2>

    <p>In the beginning all was darkness, there was a black wind on the waves<br>
    God said, “Someone turn a light on, please,” and the light he called, the day<br>
    The dark he called the night-time, and then he counted to one<br>
    And when the first day, it was finished, he said, “It was easier said than done,”</p>
 
    <p>It’s easier said than done<br>
        Startin off with less than none<br>
        Workin up towards having some<br>
        Getting past where you’re comin from<br>
        Its simpler lost than won<br>
        Likelier left than brung<br>
        Oftener spoke than sung<br>
        It’s easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>Second day God made the heavens, set em high above the earth<br>
    Then he said, “Now I’ll make what’s left to make of this here universe,”<br>
    And when the sea below the sky above he’d separated from<br>
    He reached down to wash his hands, said “It was easier said than done.”</p>
 
    <p>The Third day he made the oceans, made the rivers and the seas<br>
    The lands were carpeted with grasses and he outfitted them with trees<br>
    And out upon their branches grew the peach, the pear, the plum<br>
    And when he thought about it he thought, “It was easier said than done.”</p>
 
    <p>Fourth day he installed the stars and thereby designed the night<br>
    Then he put in all the planets and he thought it looked alright<br>
    Then he sent em in a circle goin all around the sun<br>
    And when he’d had a better look, he said “It was easier said than done.”</p>
 
    <p>Fifth day God made the creatures for the waters and the skies<br>
    Made the swordfish and the mollusk and the seagull and magpie<br>
    He said, “Let there be mosquitoes, and let them breed upon the scum,”<br>
    And lo and behold it was—and it was easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>Sixth day God made the zebra, he made the lion and the ox,<br>
    He made the lemur and the elephant and the hound-dog and the fox<br>
    He said, “From out of dust and ashes let the human beings come,”<br>
    And so people were created—and it was easier said than done.</p>
 
    <p>The Seventh day, God spoke to Adam right before he took his rest,<br>
    Said, “Do you promise to take care of this?” Adam said, “We’ll do our best,”<br>
    God was satisfied to trust him, but from the world he stood among<br>
    Adam seemed to know too well it would be easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>Well I guess some time has passed since then and now the world is getting old<br>
    The oceans have been traveled and the lands have all been sold<br>
    And some would say there’s nothing new beneath that aging sun<br>
    Some would say that proving that would be easier said than done</p>
 
    <p>But me I say the problems of the world ain’t yet been solved<br>
    People aint stopped killin folks, our problems ain’t resolved<br>
    Until the bells of mercy in the halls of justice have been rung<br>
    Love will always be a thing that’s easier said than done</p>

    <p>I knew a man, he had a lover<br>
    One day she killed him with a kitchen knife<br>
    she learned he’d been out with another<br>
    who, it turned out, the whole time, had been his wife<br>
        It’s hard to always do the right thing<br>
        It’s never an open-and-shut case<br>
        I’d rather have my cake—and eat it, too<br>
        But you can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>I know a man, had life insurance<br>
    Big old million dollar claim<br>
    He faked his death in a disappearance<br>
    now he can’t tell anyone his name<br>
        It’s hard to always do the right thing<br>
        It’s hard to know just what to chase <br>
        If I knew what I now know, a long time ago… <br>
        But you can’t always have it both ways </p>
 
    <p>Jesus Christ had many a follower<br>
    He said, “You can come along, too, if you decide,<br>
    But you can’t worship that almighty dollar<br>
    And go round thinkin you’re on my side<br>
    I know its hard to always do the right thing<br>
        When the right thing don’t hardly pay<br>
        I’d rather be a good and a rich man, <br>
        But you know you can’t always have it both ways”</p>
 
    <p>You can have all of our memories to speak to<br>
    Apologize to em, one by one<br>
    You can take all the time and words you need to<br>
    But you can’t undo what you done<br>
        And its hard to always do the right thing<br>
        The right thing changes every day<br>
        I’d rather need you—and be needed, too<br>
        But you can’t always have it both ways    </p>

    <p>Well I had me a girlfriend a while ago; I loved her, and she loved me<br>
    So I got the crazy notion to ask her if she’d want to start a family<br>
    She said yes, we both got dressed and went before the priest<br>
    He said “Anyone know why these two shouldn’t wed?  Speak now or hold your peace!” </p>
 
    <p>Well grandpa jumped up in his mighty old age and he said “there’s one reason I can see<br>
    Getting married’s not all fun and games, it’s a lot of responsibility<br>
    I don’t want to say you can’t do it, it’s just that there’s a lot to risk<br>
    Soon as you have kids, they’ll take all you got, then forget that you exist—</p>
 
    <p>And that’s all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        All the thanks you’ll get<br>
        You work hard to keep a roof abovem<br>
        They call you liar when you tellem you love em <br>
        All the thanks you get<br>
        All the thanks you get<br>
        It’s a raw deal, full-time gig<br>
        And you sure can’t raise em like your parents did<br>
        Otherwise they’ll just try and get rid—of you</p>
 
    <p>Well I went to school like folks said I should and I graduated in four years<br>
    and soon as I had received my diploma, they said, now find yourself some career<br>
    well I looked around and I couldn’t find nothing until one day, suddenly<br>
    I got a job hauling furniture for a moving company</p>
 
    <p>my first day there, they threw this party for a guy they all admired<br>
    said he’d been with the company forty years and was time for him to retire<br>
    course he was injured something terrible, he could barely keep up his head<br>
    but when he saw what he got for severance pay, this is what he said:</p>
 
    <p>That’s all the thanks I get<br>
        All the thanks I get?<br>
        broke my back, ruined my knees<br>
        paid all my own hospital fees<br>
        and that’s all the thanks I get?<br>
        All the thanks I get?<br>
        For all the time and effort I gave<br>
        Just to be treated like a slave<br>
        A one way ticket to an early grave—is my reward?</p>
 
    <p>Well I was walking by the recruiting office, with my thumb I was flippin a coin<br>
    A man was out there telling me that Uncle Sam wanted me to join<br>
    I said, “Join what?” and the recruiter said, “Why, buddy, that’s all up to you—”<br>
    Air Force, Navy, National Guard—long as it’s red, white, and blue,”</p>
 
    <p>Well I was about to sign up when all of a sudden another man comes up to me<br>
    He’s in a wheelchair and he’s got no legs and he’s wearing military fatigues<br>
    The recruiter told him to get lost, but the fella shouted out “Beware!”<br>
    He said, “I used to be just like you, now stead of legs all I got’s this chair—” </p>
 
    <p>And that’s all—the thanks you’ll get<br>
        That’s all—the thanks you’ll get <br>
        fight and kill just to stay alive <br>
        Make it home, you start to wish you had died <br>
        All—the thanks you’ll get<br>
        All—the thanks you’ll get<br>
        I’m a shell-shockd, manic-depressed<br>
        Got shards of shrapnel in my chest<br>
        Had nothing to start, now I got less—than that</p>
 
    <p>Well I was feeling sorta lost and a little confused about what I ought to do<br>
    Seems like everywhere I could think to go, there was some good reason not to <br>
    Friend of mine told me to seek some counsel, the counselor said, “Try church” <br>
    I said alright, I need help, I don’t see how that could hurt</p>
 
    <p>The preacher that Sunday was preachin a sermon bout this fella named Jesus Christ<br>
    Who helped the poor and healed the sick and never sinned in his whole life<br>
    Who taught humanity all the lessons it would ever need to learn<br>
    Who was betrayed, tortured, mocked, flogged and crucified in return</p>
 
    <p>And that’s all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        you see a problem and you try to be kind<br>
        people treat you like you’re out of your mind<br>
        all the thanks you’ll get<br>
        all the thanks you’ll get <br>
        you try to do a simple favor<br>
        lend a hand to your struggling neighbor<br>
        he don’t give you nothing for your labor—hell no—just a slap in the face     </p>

    <p>Some folks’ll tell you if you wanna be happy, havin a plan is the only way<br>
    You gotta get all your ducks in a row if you want those birds to lay<br>
    But my whole philosophy of life is, here today, then you’re gone<br>
    Might as well make the whole thing up right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>Well I went to see my fortune teller to learn about my destiny<br>
    She took ahold of both of my hands said, Well come here now, let me see<br>
    I asked her how she could tell my future just from lookin down at my palms<br>
    She winked and said, Honey, we’re just makin it up, right as we go along</p>
 
    <p>Well I got this one friend, he’s an actor, he works on the broadway stage<br>
    He’s the sorta fella can play any character of any gender, class or age<br>
    He says sometimes he’ll forget a line, but the show—it must go on<br>
    After that you’re just makin it up right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>I knew a man was a high-stakes gambler, he was a wizard at roulette<br>
    I watched him hustle a millionaire right out of the keys to a brand-new corvette<br>
    He said, you know you can’t guess right all the time, but it’s awful hard to be wrong<br>
    When you’re just makin the whole thing up, right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>I met a man could play the guitar better than anybody else I knew<br>
    Everything from jazz to swing to folk rock and the blues<br>
    He said I may not know all of the words ever written to every song<br>
    But it’s okay when you’re just makin it up right as you go along</p>
 
    <p>I got these friends, they live uptown, they make love look like such a sinch<br>
    They first met back when the war was on and they’ve been married ever since<br>
    I said, “With so many people getting divorced, how is it that you’ve stayed so strong?”<br>
    The said, Hell, we’ve just been makin it up right as we go along</p>
 
    <p>Well the Corinthians wrote to old saint paul about this problem that they had<br>
    It seems despite discovering Christianity, folks was still behaving bad<br>
    Paul wrote back and in so many words he said, “Keep calm—carry on—”<br>
    Like he was just makin the whole thing up right as he went along</p>
 
    <p>Lastnight I was watchin the old TV, and I caught some of the presidential debate<br>
    All these characters was up on stage for the audience to interrogate<br>
    Everytime anybody was accused of something, they’d deny it and say, “That’s wrong”<br>
    Just like they was just makin it up, right as they went along    </p>

    Don’t be mean, always be nice and kind<br>
    Keep your head up and do your best; make sure you get yourself plenty of rest<br>
    Be a leader, see that no one’s left behind<br>
    Chew your food, be polite, when it ain’t in use turn off the light<br>
    Don’t be late, be early, or at least be right on time<br>
    Wear a helmet, don’t get hurt, comb your hair, tuck in your shirt<br>
    Wait your turn—you’ll soon be next in line</p>
 
    <p>O but its hard to keep on grinning when everyone cept you is winnin<br>
        And everything feels like it’s spinning right down the toiletbowl’s mainstream<br>
        And even if you got that midas touch, time still turns everything to dust<br>
        Night to morning, dawn to dusk, gold to brass, steel to rust<br>
        No, nothing ain’t worth very much in the grand-scheme</p>
 
    <p>Mind your manners, mind your health, stand up straight, introduce yourself<br>
    Speak clearly, to the point, and don’t be shy<br>
    When in doubt just play it cool, keep out of trouble, stay in school<br>
    Wear your seatbelt when you drive or fly<br>
    Pay your taxes, pay your dues, pull up your pants, tie your shoes<br>
    On election day don’t forget to register and vote<br>
    Treat your neighbor as you would yourself, if you strike it rich well, share the wealth<br>
    We may have our differences, but we’re all in the same boat</p>
 
    <p>But it’s hard to keep on keepin when the liferaft’s long been leakin<br>
        And existence goes on eeking out getting more and more highstrung<br>
        And even if you got the Midas touch, time still turns everything to dust<br>
        Night to morning, dawn to dusk, gold to brass, steel to rust<br>
        No nothing ain’t worth very much in the long-run</p>
 
    <p>Don’t complain, don’t talk back, cite your sources, check your facts<br>
    If you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothing t’all<br>
    Check your tires, check your oil—bring that water to a boil<br>
    Keep your elbows up and your eye upon the ball<br>
    Always listen to your dad, pledge allegiance to the flag<br>
    Deck the halls with boughs fa la la la la la la la<br>
    Do the right thing when you can, smile for the camera man<br>
    You know the drill—blah, blah, blah, blah, blah</p>
 
    <p>But it’s hard to keep on servin when your master’s undeserving<br>
        And your loyalty’s been swerving like sparks off the main grindstone<br>
        And even if you got that Midas touch, time still turns everything to dust<br>
        Night to morning, dawn to dusk, gold to brass, steel to rust<br>
        All you get’s a “Thank You Very Much” etched on your headstone    </p>

    <h2>The Sneezing Song</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Maxims, Mantras & Moral Tales, 2021</i> Track 8</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#maximsMantras_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Well let me tell you bout a friend I know / he sneezes everywhere he goes<br>
    He’s got the worst case of allergies as I’ve seen anywhere<br>
    Aside from pollen, dust, dirt, and grass / plastic, wood, metal, glass<br>
    He’s allergic to fresh water and fresh air<br>
    Most foods he cannot touch, just says, “No thank you, very much”<br>
    Can’t have gluten, corn or wheat or flax or whey<br>
    Dogs and cats he can’t go near and most people seem to give him fear<br>
    Cause most of our conversations go this way:<br>
        “Achoo! Achoo! Pardon me!” “Bless you!”<br>
        “Would you happen to have, by any chance, a—choo!”<br>
        “If you are gonna sneeze, for goodness sakes man, use your sleeve!<br>
        And may God bless you!” “Achoo!”</p>
 
    <p>Now the thing about this friend of mine is that he gets a little bit down sometimes<br>
    On account of cause he thinks that he is scorned<br>
    People always seem to think he’s sick, sneezing like a lunatic<br>
    But he says it’s just the way that he was born<br>
    That always seems to give me pause; I guess no one’s without his flaws<br>
    “Still” he says, “I wish it wasn’t so,”<br>
    I say, “Man, don’t let it get you down, you may not be the healthiest guy in town<br>
    But you’re more God-blessed than anyone else I know”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now thinkin about this friend I got always brings me round to another thought<br>
    Concerning what is wrong and what is right<br>
    Seems that some would try to attribute the instinct to bless a sneezing brute<br>
    To manners, saying that it’s just polite<br>
    Then they’ll go ahead and designate tween folks to love and folks to hate<br>
    And say that God’ll only bless a precious few<br>
    Now I don’t know that that’s the truth, I’ve heard it said but that sure ain’t proof<br>
    But if it is, well, God help me and you<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>I prefer to think that we’re all due for at least one blessing, if not two<br>
    That it hardly matters whether we’re first or last<br>
    If you need a reason just say because sneezing’s something everybody does<br>
    No exceptions, no exclusions, or outcasts<br>
    So God Bless You: whether lost or found, high or low or up or down<br>
    God bless you, whether chained or bound for home<br>
    God bless the mad, the meek, the mild, each complaining crying child<br>
    God bless the bastard and the orphan, all alone<br>
    God bless the scoundrels and the scabs, the beggars on corners dressed in rags<br>
    And every person that’s hard pressed to find a buck<br>
    God bless the hobo and the bum, the hitchhiker with his waving thumb<br>
    God bless the truckers who’ll stop to pick him up<br>
    God bless the guilty and the innocent, the 1 and the 99 percent<br>
    God bless the ones who don’t know which ones they are<br>
    God bless the hopeless and the poor, the gangster, thug, the pimp, the whore<br>
    God bless the man who holds the door ajar<br>
    God bless all the women and the men, and anybody that’s a blend<br>
    Who falls down somewhere in between the two<br>
    Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jew; God bless the atheists, too<br>
    They all sneeze, just like me and you—achoo!<br>
    God bless the captain and the cook, the storeowner and the crook<br>
    Everyone who doesn’t look like he’s supposed to<br>
    God bless the black, the white, the red, God bless the living and the dead<br>
    And everyone who’s ever said, “Achoo!”<br>
    God bless you, whether straight or gay, God bless the ones who swing both ways<br>
    God bless the ones who don’t have to pick a side<br>
    God bless the inmates on Death Row, the strong man in the circus show<br>
    God bless the bearded woman, who’s his bride<br>
    God bless the jesters and the clowns, God bless the addicts, falling down<br>
    God bless the ones who wear crowns of gold and thorns<br>
    God bless the pope, the priest, the nun; the fans who fill up the stadium<br>
    God bless the dirty devils and their horns<br>
    God bless the doctor and the nurse, the driver of the village hearse<br>
    The gardner and the man who digs the graves<br>
    God bless the nations, each and all, God bless the world that ain’t so small<br>
    And anyone else I might’ve forgot to say<br>
        Chorus    </p>

    <p>You can’t be a locksmith if you don’t got keys<br>
    You can’t be a beekeeper if you ain’t got bees<br>
    And you can’t be a doctor if you don’t get your degrees<br>
        It doesn’t matter what your parents say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t sound the alarm if there ain’t no bell<br>
    You can’t tell the story if there’s no story to tell<br>
    You can’t have your cake and eat it as well<br>
        It doesn’t matter what the billboards say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t take it easy if you’re takin it fast<br>
    You can’t use it up and expect it to last<br>
    You can’t see the future if you’re living in the past<br>
        It doesn’t matter what the calendars say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can shop for products from the comfort of your home<br>
        Hear all about the world outside on your mobile telephone<br>
        But you can’t really be a part of it if you’re always alone<br>
        No you can’t—no you can’t</p>
 
    <p>You can’t be a boxer if you can’t take a punch<br>
    You can’t solve no mystery if you got no hunch<br>
    You can’t expect me to work without a break for lunch<br>
        I don’t care what the bosses say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t tie a strong knot if you got weak rope<br>
    You can’t have lasting love without faith and hope<br>
    I’s in love with a woman, she’s married to some dope—<br>
        It don’t matter what your vows may say<br>
        You can’t always get it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t make a difference if you don’t go and try<br>
    You can’t fulfill demand if you got no supply<br>
    You can’t give people guns and expect no one to die</p>
 
    <p>You can’t pour a blind cup and not expect it to spill<br>
    You can’t withhold supply and expect demands to be filled<br>
    You can’t give people guns and expect no one to get killed<br>
        It doesn’t matter what the laws may say <br>
        You can’t always have it both ways<br>
        You can believe everything that you hear bout on the news<br>
        Believe that folks is evil cause it’s the life they choose<br>
    But you can’t never know a person til you’ve walked round in his shoes<br>
        No you can’t—no you can’t </p>
 
    <p>From where he’s been, you can’t tell where a man’s headin<br>
    From what he says you can’t tell at what he’s gettin<br>
    and you can’t be a rich man and get into heaven<br>
        It doesn’t matter what your paystubs say<br>
        You can’t always have it both ways</p>
 
    <p>You can’t be sure if you sound so hesitant<br>
    You can’t remember seeing something that’s without precedent<br>
    You can’t be an idiot and run for president<br>
        Then again…lets see what the papers say<br>
        After all, this is the USA<br>
        Anybody can be king for just a day<br>
    Sometimes, I guess, you can have it both ways    </p>

    <p>I awoke—it was the Hour of Rest, I didn’t get any but I gave it my best<br>
    The telescreen cried, “What a beautiful day!” while outside my window all I saw was the gray<br>
    Smoke rising out of the fires below where sooner or later they tell me everyone goes<br>
    Whether you’re willing or unprepared, it doesn’t make a difference to the Man Upstairs</p>
 
    <p>I clocked in, took my place on the line, made the same old motion til it was quittin time<br>
    I got paid, went out on the town, drank a few free ones and bought a few rounds<br>
    It got late; I came home around one, got to thinking again how this has never been fun<br>
    Last thought I had before I dropped off to sleep was that if this is my life, then I’ve got to be</p>
 
    <p>On down—the road<br>
        Don’t look now but you got a long way to go</p>
 
    <p>They’re putting something in the water, it’s makin everyone smile; you don’t notice it until you’ve been without it awhile<br>
    And I’m sick now—I been puking my guts, but it’s a small price to pay to keep from goin nuts<br>
    Utopia: that’s the name of the Brand on every can, cup and bottle in the Fatherland<br>
    Where you’re free to be free, here, if only in dreams—so long as it doesn’t interrupt the machine</p>
 
    <p>I met the devil under an old willow tree—he didn’t look like such a bad fellow to me<br>
    He said, “Good and Evil: you know you cain’t always tell.  One man’s heaven is just another man’s hell—<br>
    Folks always ask me why I do what I done, I tell em it’s cause I got punished before I knew how come<br>
    They took my dignity, liberty, all that was mine; way I see it, I’m just making up for lost time—</p>
 
    <p>chorus<br>
 
    <p>In real life, there ain’t no progress at all; you get over the fence—you’re still facin a wall<br>
    your country’s the dirt underneath of your nails, your name’s just a word for when your history fails<br>
    and tomorrow, it will all be the same, the farmers will starve as they wait for the rain<br>
    the sword’s as corrupt as the soil it plowed, you can ask for permission, but you’re never allowed </p>
 
    <p>You want trouble? Here, let me give you my card—you live in a bubble and you think your life’s hard<br>
    You’re down on your knees and you’re trying to pray, but your prayers’ve been answered, 24 hours a day<br>
    We proved it; we got misery beat, you can’t argue with numbers, just rinse and repeat<br>
    Or else increase your dosage, take as much as you need; if nothing changes call me, if you need me, I’ll be—</p>
 
    <p>Chorus<br>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>I’m not lazy—I just like to rest<br>
    I’m not dirty—just not too clean, I guess<br>
    I’m not happy—but I’m doin my best<br>
        To play the hand that I been dealt<br>
    I ain’t quitting—I’m just on a break<br>
    I’m not guilty—I just made a small mistake<br>
    It’s not a setback, really—just a slight headache<br>
        It ain’t nothing that time won’t help </p>
 
    <p>But you know I haven’t come to tell you<br>
        What by now you must already know<br>
        There’s so little that has any value—<br>
        There’s only a few ways it could possibly go—</p>
 
    <p>I feel like my engine’s gone and lost a piston<br>
        Like I built a kingdom just to let it fall<br>
        You can’t resist once you’re inside the system—<br>
    And I’m just a little annoyed is all</p>
 
    <p>I’m not a cheapskate—I’m just moneywise<br>
    I’m not dishonest—I just prefer my old disguise<br>
    I’m not startled–I’m just kind of surprised<br>
        I didn’t know you were that kind of girl—<br>
    I ain’t cryin—it’s just raining out<br>
    I’m not hopeless—I’m just full of doubt<br>
    I don’t need you—I’d just prefer not to be without<br>
        Lord, it is a lonely world!</p>
 
    <p>but don’t let it go gettin your feathers ruffled<br>
        there’s really nothing else you could’ve done<br>
        the announcer’s voice coming through the mic was muffled<br>
        it could’ve happened to me or anyone—</p>
 
    <p>The lengths they’ve gone to see I’d be deprived—<br>
        Would almost make you think that my life weren’t small<br>
        But no one makes it out of this world alive<br>
        And I’m just a little annoyed is all— </p>
 
    <p>I’m not depressed—I just prefer to sing the blues<br>
    I’m not indecisive—I just don’t wanna haveta choose <br>
    I’m not complaining—I’m just looking to improve<br>
        This antiquated old machine<br>
    I ain’t weak—I’m just not that strong<br>
    We’re not incompatible—we just don’t really get along<br>
    It ain’t alright—don’t you get me wrong<br>
        I ain’t sayin it’s peachy-keen</p>
 
    <p>Sometimes I wish it would all go backwards<br>
        You’d begin at grief and move headlong into loss<br>
        You’d heal up as soon as you removed the daggers<br>
        you regain everything when you refund the cost— </p>
 
    <p>But without an ending, there ain’t no story<br>
        No happily ever after after all<br>
        The case is closed with the hanging jury<br>
        And I’m just a little annoyed is all—</p>
 
    <p>I’m not sick—I just don’t feel all that well<br>
    It’s not a secret—I just don’t really care to tell<br>
    I’m not withholdin—I just don’t have anything good to sell<br>
        or anything more to subtract—<br>
    I’m not crazy—I just haven’t found my groove <br>
    I’m not vindictive—I just don’t really like to lose<br>
    I’m not unjustified—I just don’t got no good excuse <br>
         Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
 
    <p>Won’t somebody give me some instruction<br>
        On whatever a man’s supposed to do? <br>
        I can’t seem to make any logical deduction<br>
        I can’t have my cake and eat it, too</p>
 
    <p>I feel like a powder keg what’s about to burst<br>
    Soon they’ll be scrapin me off the wall—<br>
    I’m surrounded by water and I’m dyin of thirst<br>
    And I’m just a little annoyed is all</p>
 
    <p>I’m not a hard case—I’m just difficult<br>
    I don’t intend it—you know that much yourself<br>
    I’m not in trouble—I just need a little bit of help<br>
        At some point, hell, don’t we all?<br>
    I’m not wrongheaded—I’m just incorrect<br>
    I’m not crazy—I’m just a little out of step <br>
    I’m not angry—I’m not even that upset<br>
        I’m just a little annoyed is all    </p>

    <p>I’d give up my ticket to travel first-class<br>
    Step out of my place in a long line, and be last<br>
    Tip my hat to the VIPs, and bid them aideu<br>
    As long as it meant that I could be—<br>

    <p>I’d compromise anything I claim to believe in<br>

    I’d welcome the chance for a new point of view<br>

    <p>I’d give up my dayjob tho it pays well and is easy<br>
    I’d come down off the mountain to live in the city<br>
    I’d share a crowded apartment on a loud avenue—<br>
    As long as it meant that I could be—<br>
        Close to you</p>
 
    <p>I’d pass up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity<br>
    disobey the wishes of my entire community<br>
    all kinds of trouble I’d get myself into<br>
    As long as it meant that I could be—<br>

    <p>If you were sick, I would risk the infection<br>
    If I knew you were wrong, I wouldn’t make no correction<br>

    <p>Corruption in the Whitehouse: headline ran in ‘72<br>
    When Nixon’s men broke in to the DNC HQ<br>
    If Deepthroat hadn’t telephoned his buddies, Carl and Bob<br>
    Nixon probably never would have turned over his job—so<br>
    Blow the whistle!—whistleblower, blow!<br>
    Let’s see you got a conscience that you ain’t afraid to show<br>
    Put your self-interest behind you, tell your bosses where to go—<br>
    the people have got the right to know</p>
 
    <p>Chelsea Manning was a soldier sent to Iraq on intel<br>
    Where civilians and enemies were bein indiscriminately killed<br>
    She had access to top secret files that were under lock-and-key<br>
    She put em on a website for all the world to see<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Well, all our data’s now the property of the US government<br>
    the NSA’s been getting it for years without consent<br>
    A man named Edward Snowden said “I’ve had enough of this!”<br>
    Sent what he knew discreetly to the international press<br>
    chorus</p>
 
    <p>Today we got old Donald Trump to keep us entertained<br>
    “Will you look into Joe Biden?” he asked the president of Ukraine<br>
    He would’ve been impeached when someone brought the news to light—<br>
    If a few Senate Republicans had the nerve to do what’s right!<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>Now some will say a whistleblower’s nothin but a liar<br>
    A stoolie turned a turncoat who knew he’d be getting fired <br>
    If you were in the same boat—tell me, what would you do? <br>
    And if you knew and kept it secret—well, what would that make you?<br>
    chorus</p>
 
    <p>I thank you, Mr. Snowden for all the risk you took—<br>
    And you, Ms. Chelsea Manning, you’re no traitor in my book<br>
    You face the blacklist, exile, prison, and you were slandered in the news<br>
    But I thank you for the sacrifice you’ve made to tell the truth<br>
        chorus</p>
 
    <p>technology today is more advanced than it’s alleged<br>
    but it’s a tool that can be weaponized, a blade that’s double edged<br>
    the government says they spy on us to keep us all Red, White and Blue<br>
    But if you’re gonna keep your eyes on us, we’ll keep our eyes on you! <br>

    <h2>How Long (I'll Love You For)</h2>

    <p>Seasons change, climate, too<br>
    and people change—Lord knows I do<br>
    If impermanence is all that holds true<br>
    then what else can I hold onto?</p>
 
    <p>I’m sometimes right; I’m often wrong<br>
    We’ll know better further along<br>
    Your love is mighty, but how strong<br>
    You say you love me—yes—but for how long?</p>
 
    <p>Long as the seas meet land at shore<br>
    And earth pursues Her solar tour<br>
    long as this old heart endures—<br>
    That’s how long <br>
    That’s how long<br>
    That’s how long—I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>When I’m tired; when I’m wakeful<br>
    tho unworthy, not ungrateful;<br>
    year after year, may through april<br>
    long as you’re willing, I will be able</p>
 
    <p>long as there’s still room to grow<br>
        sky above and sea below<br>
        long as there’s time left to explore<br>
        that’s how long<br>
        that’s how long<br>
        that’s how long I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>Pick a number any one<br>
    Better yet, make it the highest one<br>
    Multiply it by ten billion<br>
    Throw in a few more—and then some</p>
 
    <p>As far as you can comprehend<br>
        And even further, after the end—<br>
        As long as there’s something still left in store<br>
        That’s how long<br>
        That’s how long<br>
        That’s how long I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>The day may come, I’ll be leavin<br>
    A few who knew me might hang round grieving<br>
    There’s a time for laughter and a time for weeping<br>
    And long as I’m standing, Long as I’m breathing</p>
 
    <p>As long as time withstands the clock<br>
        If it speeds up or if it stops—<br>
        Til kingdom’s come or come no more—<br>
        that’s how long I’m gonna love you for </p>
 
    <p>pick your poison, choose your pleasure<br>
    step by step, measure for measure<br>
    life is short, love’s forever<br>
    long as you’ll have me, then we’ll be together</p>
 
    <p>now and later, then, meanwhile<br>
        apart, together, single file <br>
        both and and and either or<br>
        that’s how long I’m gonna love you for</p>
 
    <p>love prefers the present tense<br>
    it receives more, the more it sends<br>
    its road goes on, around both bend<br>
    a lifelong journey that never ends</p>
 
    <p>(Repeat first chorus)<br>

    <h2>Work Harder (Get Paid the Same)</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Poor Thing, 2022</i> Track 6</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The factory whistle sounded at dawn, so we all gathered out on the floor<br>
    Foreman says, “You’re all doin so well, we thought you could do a little bit more—<br>
    He gave us our orders, said “Now I don’t want to hear anybody complain—”<br>
    You’ll be workin harder and harder, but you’re getting paid the same”</p>
 
    <p>The economy’s gone belly-up, business is following suit<br>
    Boss is keepin his salary, but he’s givin his workers the boot<br>
    Said, “Some’ll haveta be let go, for the rest of ya, all that’ll change<br>
    Is you’ll be working a little bit harder, but you’re gettin paid the same”</p>
 
    <p>Work harder—get paid the same!<br>
        It’s the company slogan—the name of the game!<br>
        It’s better than nothin! Don’t whine and complain!<br>
        You work harder—and you get paid the same! </p>
 
    <p>The cost of livin is on the rise and the landlord’s been raising the rent<br>
    Soon all the money you’ve set aside has gone the way the rest of it went<br>
    Tomorrow’s another workin day, a chance for to make and to gain<br>
    You’ll work a little bit harder, but you’ll be getting paid the same</p>
 
    <p>Society says do your best and there’s nothin you can’t achieve<br>
    You want to get rich quick in these times of ours—all you’ve got to do is believe!<br>
    I waited in line, put in my time, kept my head down, stayed in my lane<br>
    I worked harder and harder, but I just got paid the same</p>
 
    <p>Uncle Sam’s building an army, recruiting anyone he can find<br>
    He’ll tell you he’ll pay for your college if you just sign on the old dotted line<br>
    He’ll train you to hunt down and kill a man like he ain’t got a face or a name<br>
    You’ll work for him, harder and harder, and he’ll repay you just the same</p>
 
    <p>When I’s up I counted my blessings, when I’s down I looked to the Lord<br>
    I followed the rules to the letter—and I still ain’t received no reward<br>
    I’m no saint, by no means, Lord, to be humble, I’ve never claimed<br>
    But I’m workin harder and harder—and I’m getting paid the same</p>
 
    <p>History seems like a broken machine that spits out whatever’s put in<br>
    Despite how you’ve fought, your efforts have brought you to someplace you’ve already been<br>
    You can try a new course or keep beatin the dead horse as you pray for something to change<br>
    Feels like workin harder and harder just to keep getting paid the same</p>
 
    <p>I tried to break free of the eternity of running around on my wheel<br>
    I bought a guitar and I got in my car and went out to find something more real<br>
    I followed along and practiced the songs and by now I’ve learned the refrain:<br>
    It’s: work harder and harder and get paid the same</p>
 
    <p>Now the man upstairs is good and old, he’s been in charge for a while<br>
    To him it makes no difference if you owe him an inch or a mile<br>
    Whether your life’s been filled with privilege or if it’s been filled with pain<br>
    Righteous or wreckless, you get paid the same</p>
 
    <p>When I’m called I’ll rise and go—I won’t make any to-do<br>
    I prayed for things I needed bad, but my prayers just never got through<br>
    Naked and crying I’ll leave the world as naked and crying I came<br>
    I kept workin harder and harder—and kept getting paid the same    </p>

    <h2>I Didn't Even Stand a Chance</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Poor Thing, 2022</i> Track 7</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>The ferris-wheel’s been crammed with likely suspects<br>
    the boardwalk’s lit up like it’s Christmas in July<br>
    there comes a time when a man must stand and face his prospects<br>
    with a keen, discerning and judicious eye <br>
    I came prepared, my equipment all was with me<br>
    I knew the odds would be against me in advance<br>
        But by the time I even knew what had gone and hit me—<br>
        It was too late—I didn’t even stand a chance </p>
 
    <p>I’ve tried to keep my eye out for any sign of danger<br>
    I didn’t want to be the victim of love’s charm<br>
    I’ve learned to be suspicious of every stranger<br>
    And I’ve been known to greet unexpected kindness with alarm<br>
        I hope that you don’t think I went and planned this <br>
        If there’s one thing I’d rather skip, well, it’s romance<br>
        But when I met you, I was already disadvantaged <br>
        It was too late—I didn’t even stand a chance—</p>
 
    <p>I’m well-practiced in the art of getting nowhere<br>
    I’ve rehearsed this scene a hundred thousand times<br>
    I know just what to say if you decide to go there<br>
    You’ll be on your way, and I’ll keep on mine—<br>
        But it would seem that habit’s failed me in this instance <br>
        I heard the music and got caught up in the dance— <br>
    I intended to give nothing but resistance<br>
        But it was too late—I didn’t even stand a chance </p>
 
    <p>You stood there looking far out at the ocean<br>
    Where the sky and water fused in a streak of blue<br>
    I’ve seen beauty that’s stirred my heart into commotion—<br>
    None of it could hold a candle up to you<br>
        I could feel the stealing-in of love’s intruders<br>
        My guard was let down, you had me drifting in a trance<br>
        Cupid must have raised an army of sharpshooters<br>
        outnumbered—I didn’t even stand a chance </p>
 
    <p>this must be what the bards and poets tell of<br>
    when they retire to their rooms to play and sing<br>
    and write their ballads all about their true-loves<br>
    what good’s it all—when sorrow’s all it brings?<br>
        I tried to put the feeling into language <br>
        My “Love at first sight” she destroyed with just a glance <br>
        Now the rapture and the joy’s turned into anguish<br>
        I should’ve known—I didn’t even stand a chance    </p>

    <p>Every place you go there’s folks there aiming to please—<br>
    The way you spend your money, it’s like it was growin on the trees<br>
    And even though you tell me that you didn’t come from royalty<br>
    Well, babe, you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>I’m not one to fall for that old vanishing act<br>
    I know just when the magician’s pullin a rabbit from his hat<br>
    I can usually sense when someone’s got something up her sleeve<br>
    But babe, you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>You got me where you want me, I’m too slow to dodge—<br>
        Just say the word and I’ll stay<br>
        I’m useful as a busted-up, broken down watch<br>
        Even a broken watch is still right—two times a day</p>
 
    <p>I ain’t one to believe every single thing I see<br>
    I don’t believe a word of what they tell me on TV<br>
    I ain’t one who’s known for his gullibility<br>
    But babe you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>They asked you for your effort, so you gave it your best try<br>
    When you folded from the pressure, they caught you in a lie<br>
    you couldn’t outfox the moral majority<br>
    But babe you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>I ain’t the sharpest knife in the set—<br>
        Is that how the expression even goes?<br>
        Feel like I’m looking for something I ain’t found yet<br>
        But every time I’m near you feels like I’m getting close—</p>
 
    <p>My mama warned me about women of your kind<br>
    She said don’t be chasing no one whose gonna make you wait your turn in line<br>
    Just goin by your looks, I could’ve swore you was heavenly<br>
    babe, you could’ve shore fooled me</p>
 
    <p>You know I’m getting older, I got water on the knee<br>
    You know that my eyes ain’t what they used to be—<br>
    You think you’re nothing special for anyone to see—<br>
    Well, babe, you could’ve shore fooled me    </p>

    <p>They’re saying by next year this land’ll be buried neath 35 feet of the sea<br>
    Those that can’t get out by liner or ferry will be sinking as sure as can be<br>
    Pharoah traded his army for a fleet of sleek vessels, if the seas part he’ll just run aground<br>
    Tell moses we’re sorry: salvation’s backordered—there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>Ma quit her job the day she delivered tho she took all six weeks of her leave<br>
    The breadcrumb of income in the end hardly differed, daycare costs more than you’d believe<br>
    And dad’s been out lookin for a job that’ll get him off the trail of them debt-collector hounds<br>
    Wherever he goes the employers all tell em, there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>Man on the sidewalk’s been asking for quarters from people who pretend he ain’t there<br>
    His cardboard sign reads: I’ll Have What You’re Having—Anything That You Can Spare<br>
    He says, “I been all through the towns of this country, small kindness is all that I’ve found<br>
    Loves all you need to get by in this life, and there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>You’d better wear waiters if you’re headed to Washington, I hear the bullshit there’s pretty deep<br>
    Power is one thing that people in power usually do their darndest to keep<br>
    They’re redrawing districts makin maps into mazes so that when voting day rolls around<br>
    The hopes’ll wear thin til the votes are all in and there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>The army recruiters are lookin for heroes to wave their American flag<br>
    They’ll send you abroad like they need you to be there til you get sent back home in a bag<br>
    A six-gun salute, an immaculate coffin, a white cross they’ll stake in the ground<br>
    The letter to mom says “your son was a patriot—wish there were more like him to go round.”</p>
 
    <p>They ask for our patience in the questing for justice, that holy of holymost grails<br>
    They ask us to trust their defunct machinery that history shows usually fails<br>
    The judge in his throne hasn’t even been listening—you’ll know when til the gavel comes down<br>
    They’re doling out justice like there’ll be no tomorrow—and there just ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>We’ve dug ourselves into a fine mess of trouble spending money that we never had<br>
    To buy things that wore out and made us unhappy which they told us would make us more glad<br>
    The poor get some—yes, but the rich get a tax-cut: and do you know why it’s called ‘trickledown’?<br>
    a trickle’s what happens before it shuts off completely leaving what ain’t enough to go round</p>
 
    <p>Time is a bastard and a thieving deceptor, a current you fight the whole way<br>
    Tomorrow eludes you while yesterday woos you meanwhile it’s always today<br>
    And life is a tale told by an idiot full up of fury and sound<br>
    You look for the meaning with the hourglass bleeding—there just ain’t enough to go round    </p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#poorThing_album">Back to Album</a></h4>
    <p>Dear country, I’m writing to tell you I’m fighting to come up with some single thing<br>
    To ignite or inspire the old poet’s desire, in me, of thee, to sing—<br>
    But no praise can I utter with my pride in the gutter as the national anthem gets sung<br>
    To a flag that looks dignified that always has signified: liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I’ve poured through the mystery of American history that was told from the conqueror’s view<br>
    That corrupted a heritage to respin a narrative about what white colonizers went through<br>
    Who committed a genocide, vanquished a countryside, which through outrageous violence was won<br>
    Executing hypocrisy in the name of democracy, with liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been stumbling and reeling as I grope for the feeling of freedom spelled out in the pomes<br>
    But what of the Apache, the Blackfoot, Comanche, the Africans, torn from their homes?<br>
    Your freedom’s to subjugate, enslave, kill, appropriate—when will we be free from<br>
    The powers that perpetrate, promote and perpetuate liberty and justice for some?</p>
 
    <p>they say here you’re free to do whatever you want to do—it’s true, long as you got the means<br>
    without any middle, most have less than little, while a few hoard an amount that’s obscene<br>
    and I don’t see an end to it when sixty percent of it will remain in the hands of just one<br>
    a condition arisen from capitalism, which lends liberty and justice to some</p>
 
    <p>At the borders they’ve ordered soldiers to bolster the walls they put up as defense<br>
    To stop immigration to an immigrant nation that’s composed of what it’s now against<br>
    Inventing solutions citing The Constitution to further qualify the word: “Everyone”<br>
    Giving no heeding to words or their meanings where there’s liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I turn on the TV most evenings all I see are tragedies broadcast as news<br>
    A white officer shooting a black man refusing to admit to what he didn’t do<br>
    in the grief and excitement the cries for indictment to the highest authority’s brung <br>
    which forgives law enforcement and displays the endorsement that there’s liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>The acts of our president are now without precedent, he’s made crimes that the Senate won’t try—<br>
    Proving by the hour that for people in power the rules just don’t seem to apply<br>
    Acting outrageously, speaking insensibly in tired corruptible tongues<br>
    Outlawing innocence to celebrate ignorance, with liberty and justice for some</p>
 
    <p>I stood in my vacuum at the back of the classroom, taking History over again<br>
    With the teacher insistin that everyone listen and kindly repeat after him:<br>
    “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the U—” hang on a minute—how come?<br>
    One nation, miserable, neath God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for some—    </p>

    <p>I can’t remember the words to this song<br>
    Wrote em down but didn’t bring em along<br>
    Now I’m confessin—I’m just guessin<br>
    I still got the tune, but the rest is gone—</p>
 
    <p>If I could remember just the first line<br>
    the second would be easy cause it probably rhymes<br>
    but it ain’t no use—I got no excuse—<br>
    And I must’ve played the thing a million times</p>
 
    <p>But I know the chorus goes like this:<br>
         —anyway, you get the gist<br>
        But this part right here, it’s in the bag—<br>
        Cause this song’s called the “Something Something Rag” </p>
 
    <p>I thought maybe if I just kept playing the song<br>
    The words’d come back—boy was I wrong!<br>
    I still got nothing—I’m just bluffing<br>
    Tune’s still here, but the rest’s still gone</p>
 
    <p>Here’s that chorus again<br>
        Somewhere we’ve already been<br>
        This is the worst luck I’ve ever had<br>
        I forgot the words to the something something rag</p>
 
    <p>Instrumental!<br>
 
    <p>Maybe you’re thinking: “Man, this guy sucks<br>
    Sure wish he’d get off the stage and shut up<br>
    What’s he doin?—who’s he foolin<br>
    He’s rehearsed it this way to make it sound made up—</p>
 
    <p>He’s playin the chorus one last time<br>
        To really drive home how hard he’s tryin<br>
        Someone should tell him that his song was bad— <br>

    <p>a cup of coffee still sits untouched<br>
    Right where I left it back there in the diner <br>
    Her message sounded like she’d been rushed<br>
    I thought I knew where I might find her<br>
    So I crossed several dozen mid-sized states<br>
    Along a road she had once named her shortcut<br>
    believing as I recalled her stubborn traits<br>
    that Love was one thing she’d never aim to forfeit<br>
    But my instinct’s slow—to overthrow<br>
        Any notion that the worst’s come true <br>
        any chance I’d take—if it’d help me make <br>
        My way back to you</p>
 
    <p>a soldier stopped me where the road dissolved<br>
    and showed me your portrait from the riot<br>
    he said, “She’s wanted—we think she’s somehow involved,”<br>
    I knew exactly what he meant by it;<br>
    So I followed the river to the shore<br>
    When I came to the sea, I went ahead and crossed it<br>
    The ferryman told me not to bother him no more<br>
    “If ever you ever had any luck with me, you’ve just gone and lost it”<br>
    Now I’m on the road—it’s getting cold<br>
        I’m inside out—I’m black and blue<br>
    I’m left behind—still trine to find<br>
        My way back to you</p>
 
    <p>The signs say one thing, but they mean something else<br>
    In the end it’s all somehow connected<br>
    If you want to get something done in this life, you’d better go and do it by yourself<br>
    But look out: it won’t be at all what you expected<br>
    The clues I’ll gather, the leads, exhaust<br>
    If there only were some way, I would quit hoping <br>
    All the crime scene tape reads: Do Not Cross<br>
    And when the gun turns up, it’s never smoking<br>
        I’m in a daze—unamazed  <br>
        feeling something not unlike deja vu<br>
        for goodness sake, I’m just trine to make <br>
        my way back to you</p>
 
    <p>BRIDGE:<br>
                I don’t need to know yet, I can wait and see—</p>
 
    <p>So I’ll wander down along the beaten path<br>
    I ain’t no pioneer, no trailblazer<br>
    You think I’m out for glory—hell, don’t make me laugh<br>
    I just wish I could reign in my own behavior<br>
    I’ll never give up, I’ll never cease to try—<br>
    I never did know how to surrender<br>
    They tell me beauty’s something exists in the beholder’s eye<br>
    But it feels like it’s her spell that I’m under—<br>
        It’s one more excuse—to win or lose <br>
        feel like my nine lives by now’s down to two<br>
        I’m in a pinch—just trying to inch<br>
        my way back to you</p>
 
    <p>in a different place, maybe, at another time<br>
    in the event of some extreme reversal<br>
    if it was you who had fallen, been stricken blind<br>
    and the story had made it round, full-circle<br>
    maybe if we’d checked it sooner from running completely wild<br>
    none of this ever would have happened—<br>
    I just wish you could be reconciled<br>
    Being that there’s nothing left for your subtraction<br>
        I’m in the gale—I’m on the trail<br>
        I’m almost done—I’m nearly through <br>
    I’m making time—still trine to find<br>
        My way back to you    </p>

    <p>6 a.m. and across the street the widow’s tearing out her flowerbed<br>
    Where there never have been roses and where nothing’s ever grown<br>
    You would almost think to see her there that it wasn’t all inside her head<br>
    You’d almost think she might just make it alright on her own<br>
        And lacing up your boots you think, “Absurd, absurd,”<br>
        As her child comes to wrap her in long sleeves<br>
        On the steps she holds her hand and you can just make out her words,<br>
        She says, “Mom, you’re the one who’s supposed to care for me…”<br>
            But you know how it is living in a small town <br>
            Where there’s only so much you can do<br>
            Where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            That anyone could ever love it much as you</p>
 
    <p>The line outside the bakery has all the usual customers<br>
    The milkman and the paperboy and the girl who runs the store<br>
    It’s February and it’s cold outside and the weather doesn’t feel too sure<br>
    One of them’s calling in to Mikee to come and open up his door<br>
        He steps out on the porch and says, “get off! Get off!”<br>
        Even as he gathers them inside<br>
        He pours them each a coffee and says, “You know I’ve had enough,” <br>
        And it doesn’t cost him nothing but his pride<br>
            But you know how it is living in a small town<br>
            Where somehow you came to be but not to stay<br>
            Where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            That they could all get on without you for one day</p>
 
    <p>Abraham’s a housepainter, he’s had cancer for a couple years<br>
    Lives alone inside a trailer in the woods behind the line<br>
    His wife divorced him long ago said she simply couldn’t stand the tears<br>
    That she had to leave him first if she would make it through his dying<br>
        Occasionally he stops in, says, “Hello, hello!”<br>
        When he’s feelin well she lets him see the kids<br>
        Every time she says it breaks her heart—each time he says he knows<br>
        He says, “We couldn’t know I’d make it like I did—”<br>
            But you know how it is living in a small town<br>
            Where you know each story and every name<br>
            Where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            That when you came back it’d still be just the same</p>
 
    <p>The town was never popular but it used to host a carnival<br>
    In the park between the firehouse and the church no one attends<br>
    the only famous person who ever lived here was a criminal<br>
    and he really wasn’t half as bad as everyone pretends<br>
        there’s a restaurant and a hotel and a bar, a bar<br>
        and all the roads lead to the river just behind the railroad track<br>
        and perhaps because I’ve heard it said, ‘True places never are’<br>
        my town, it is not down, on any map<br>
            but you know how it is, living in a small town<br>
            where it’s hard to dream of even feeling lost<br>
            where you know you’d leave if you could just believe<br>
            that that feeling even distance could exhaust    </p>

    <p>Jacob had himself about seven sons<br>
    And Joseph was his favorite one<br>
    And Joseph dreamed a simple dream<br>
    That the filthy ones would be made clean<br>
    that the empty ones would be made full<br>
    that the broken ones would again be whole;<br>
    Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen? Amen!</p>
 
    <p>When his brothers learned it was so<br>
    They all conspired to have him slo<br>
    One day they all went on a trip<br>
    They cast him down into a pit<br>
    Joseph didn’t put up much fight<br>
    But he never did quite lose his life<br>
    His life was spared and he was made a slave<br>
    He served Egyptians night and day<br>
    He served a man named Potiphar<br>
    The captain of the Pharaoh’s guard<br>
    He liked Joseph well—until one night<br>
    He walked in on Joseph with his wife<br>
    Potiphar had him thrown in jail<br>
    But the Lord was with him in the jail<br>
    Chorus</p>
 
    <p>And when the pharaoh dreamed a puzzling dream<br>
    He asked everybody, “What’s it mean?”<br>
    Joseph said, “I know what it means—”<br>
    And he explained the meaning of his dream<br>
    When the Pharaoh heard his dream described<br>
    He felt his eyes had been opened wide<br>
    And he brought him out and it was seen<br>
    That the filthy one had been made clean<br>
    That the empty one had been made full<br>
    That the broken one had been made whole<br>

    <p>Danny and Julia were dressed in their Sunday best<br>
    Though it was a Tuesday and already snowing<br>
    The cabbie who drove agreed to be their one wedding-guest<br>
    On the condition that they let him leave his meter going<br>
        The procedure was quick, the presider had seen to it<br>
        Some words of intent and the optional kiss<br>
        Life lay ahead, and he carried her into it<br>
        Down through the snow on the courthouse steps </p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where agreements are sanctified<br>
    promises notarized, futures foretold—<br>
    punishments doled out—arguments justified<br>
    slow gears rotated and fast ones pulled</p>
 
    <p>Frankie the Fist had seen plenty of things, I’m sure,<br>
    He’d worked for a gang that had moved contraband<br>
    One night, the police – raided their weapons store<br>
    Frankie got out with a slap on the hand—<br>
        The boss went to jail for holding and questioning<br>
        When the trial date came, Frankie showed with the Feds <br>
        There was the sound of a gun, unmistakable, deafening—<br>
        and Frankie fell dead on the courthouse steps </p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where what goes around comes around<br>
    Where you’re made to speak up while you’re fighting to breathe <br>
    Where a man can be beat and kicked when he’s fallen down<br>
    And Lady Luck’s always got one more card up her sleeve</p>
 
    <p>John Henry’s case had unfortunate precedence:<br>
    A black man accused of a white homicide<br>
    the all-white jury was presented with evidence<br>
    it took them all of about ten minutes to decide—<br>
    A TV news crew sent to report on it<br>
        Caught the moment the defense began the protest:<br>
        crying: “If justice ain’t served in the halls that were built for it—<br>
        Then let it be done on the courthouse steps!”</p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where the shadow of justice falls<br>
        On weeping and wailing and the gnashing of teeth<br>
        On the eyes of the pained, their backs up against the walls<br>
        Their hearts more inflamed by Time and by Grief</p>
 
    <p>Oil & Coal were the wealthiest trades, by far—<br>
    Til the disposal of waste caused the profits to tank<br>
    Sure, they took on some risk making trips to the reservoir<br>
    til it all trickled back to the water they drank—<br>
        First people got sick, and then they began to die<br>
        And slowly the pieces began to connect—<br>
        By the time of the trial, thousands agreed to testify, <br>
        The whole town in line on the courthouse steps</p>
 
    <p>On the courthouse steps—where the end of the tale is set<br>
    Where eventually all of the odds become even<br>
    The defense lawyer yawns and puts out his cigarette<br>
    Sayin a prayer to the God he can’t bring himself to believe in</p>
 
    <p>John Fontleroy was arrested for battery<br>
    He’d been charged years before with killing his wife<br>
    The Not Guilty verdict came from some technicality <br>
    About how they’d never been able to turn up the knife—<br>
        But now there was proof; and he was in custody<br>
        He called his lawyer to tell him he was under arrest<br>
        His lawyer just laughed and said “Man, double jeopardy—<br>
    You’ll be free fore you get to the courthouse steps.”</p>
 
    <p>The courthouse steps—where fortunes are overturned<br>
    Where right and wrong change with a roll of the dice<br>
    Where the innocent—can be tied to the stake and burned—<br>
    But you can’t charge the guilty for the same crime twice</p>
 
    <p>Danny and Julia, dressed in their Sunday best<br>
    With two kids between them, and their lawyers beside<br>
    The divorce was prepared, but there was still all the rest—<br>
    the house, finances, custody to decide<br>
        The procedure cost more than either one could afford to pay<br>
        But they still hadn’t reached any agreement yet— <br>
        And so they emerged—each going their separate way, <br>
    Down through the snow on the courthouse steps     </p>

    <p>It was me and Parker’d been assigned the case<br>
    By lieutenant Flood, without a trail to chase<br>
    The thing was messy, so said the Sarge<br>
    A child missing, thieves at large—<br>
    It was your classic ransom, a demand to trade<br>
    The victims wealthy and so they could’ve paid <br>
    But to fool the bandits, the parents had tried<br>
    And so now the ‘Missing Person’ was a ‘Homicide’<br>
        Sarge looked at Flood and Flood met my eyes<br>
    Said, ‘I hope discretion you can exercise—'<br>
    ‘If a man can’t do,’ said Parker, ‘what his bosses ask—<br>
        He ain’t fit to wear no gun and badge’</p>
 
    <p>The grieving father, in a vengeful state<br>
    Hired on some outside associate<br>
    Nobody talkin saw what all went down<br>
    At that farm-house hide-out on the edge of town<br>
    Six men with escorts, all of them inside<br>
    When the building burned down, none survived—<br>
    One of the victims was Ms. Velma Pearl<br>
    And we soon found out she’d been Sarge’s girl—<br>
        So we went to Sarge with our discovery—<br>
        He dismissed us sayin  ‘bring your report to me—<br>
        If he goes to pieces when he’s feelin torn—<br>
    That man ain’t fit to wear this uniform’</p>
 
    <p>So it was me drove Parker along the killer’s route<br>
    to ask a few more question, see what we could find out<br>
    Up Dead Man’s Hill, as we approached the crest<br>
    Parker took two bullets—through the head and chest<br>
    And later that night—down in Evidence<br>
    Flood returned a rifle, and his innocence—<br>
    He never signed it, in or out, of course<br>
    But the bullets matched the ones in Parker’s corpse—<br>
        And I know he’ll say it when he takes the stand<br>
        He’ll tell you all about the chain of command<br>
        How if a man can’t do what his bosses ask:<br>
        That man ain’t fit to wear no gun and badge’</p>
 
    <p>When you’re in the precinct, it’s like the corps<br>
    There’s a code of honor, an oath that’s swore<br>
    I asked the Sarge once about his divorce<br>
    He said ‘cop’s true love is always The Force’<br>
    When you’re on the force, the command’s a chain <br>
    And that’s the meaning behind everything<br>
    It’s all for one and one for all<br>
    Until your in trouble, then it’s “lowest takes the fall”<br>
        And I took an oath to protect and serve<br>
    But not men like these, that you can be sure of—<br>
        And if he can’t do right—or tell the truth when asked—<br>
        He shouldn’t wear no gun and badge    </p>

    <p>In the days when the world was young and raw<br>
    There lived a man who was without flaw<br>
    ten kids, a wife, for family<br>
    crops, livestock and property—<br>
    he was unselfish and didn’t hoard<br>
    both night and day he thanked the Lord<br>
    and abundantly, his gladness flowed<br>
    they said there’d never been a man like Job—<br>
        Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen? Amen!</p>
 
    <p>In those days the devil was like most men<br>
    One day the Lord called unto him:<br>
    He said, “Satan, as you’ve roamed the road—<br>
    Have you ever seen a man like Job?<br>
    Whose gratefulness cannot be quelled<br>
    Whose faithfulness is unparalleled<br>
    Whose humanness is such quality—<br>
    Who night and day, worships me<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>Devil said, “He’s something—but he ain’t much—<br>
    You gave that fella the Midas touch<br>
    Go ahead and put him to the test<br>
    You’ll see he’s just like all the rest.<br>
    Deprive him, lay his life to waste—<br>
    You’ll see him curse you to your face.<br>
    There’s a side to Job you’ve never met<br>
    How much do you wanna bet?”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>So Job stood in his field one day<br>
    When a messenger arrived to say:<br>
    “We were beset by enemy swords <br>
    They took your horses, killed your herds…”<br>
    And as he spoke, another came:<br>
    “They’ve killed your men, Job, burned your grain…”<br>
    And as that one spoke, a third arrived<br>
    “Your sons and daughters all have died,”<br>
    Their stories ended all the same<br>
    With the morbid, mournful, sad, refrain:<br>
    “You’ve been deprived, you are bereft<br>
    To tell the tale I’m all that’s left—”<br>
        Chorus</p>
 
    <p>In light of all this news his faith<br>
    amazingly remained in place<br>
    The man they said had been unflawed<br>
    Lost everything and prayed to God<br>
    And for seven days he did not eat<br>
    And for seven nights he did not sleep<br>
    Except for this he barely spoke<br>
    “What the Lord provides He may revoke” <br>
    He tore his clothes and shaved his head<br>
    When he finished prayin, this is what he said:<br>

    <p>Last night it was fair game / drinkin whiskey and champagne<br>
    Somebody offered me cocaine / in a bathroom stall<br>
    But this morning I’m reeling / my head’s split and I’m feeling<br>
    Like too much of a good thing / ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>I drank from the flagon / I went chasing dragon<br>
    You know it took the whole gallon for a buzz that felt small<br>
    Damn right I’m complaining, it’s just myself that I’m blaming—<br>
    Too much of a good thing ain’t no good at all</p>
 
    <p>The game was amazing / I mean the cards I was playing<br>
    They went all in and I raised em / it was just too good to call<br>
    I won the motherload payout / then got robbed on my way out<br>
    yeah too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>from a toxic envir’n’ment / you were beauty incarnate<br>
    in your second-hand garment / and some kind of a shawl<br>
    what did you have against me that you had to convince me<br>
    that too much of a good thing ain’t no good at all?</p>
 
    <p>Dawn broke to acknowledge that the room was demolished<br>
    The brass had lost all its polish and there was a hole in the wall<br>
    I tried bein honest, but no good deed goes unpunished—<br>
    Too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>No doubt it’s recorded how my risks were rewarded<br>
    How the plans that I thwarted did abhor and appall—<br>
    it’s like my mama done taught me / fore the sheriff done caught me<br>
    she said too much of a good thing ain’t no good at all</p>
 
    <p>I’ve savored and lavished, refrained from and ravished,<br>
    I’ve evenly averaged, on the whole, overall—<br>
    but obeying the treaty only profits the greedy <br>
    too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>I’ve been out to lunches with the generals and judges<br>
    I’ve rolled with the punches of bureaucracy’s brawl<br>
    They claim that their shutting / of doors is a good thing<br>
    well, too much of a good thing ain’t no damn good at all</p>
 
    <p>You fast and you famish, resist all you can manage<br>
    Your desires you banish like the ice from a thaw<br>
    Until one day you grow up and you gorge til you throw up<br>
    And learn too much of a good thing / ain’t no damn good at all    </p>

    <p>Daddy sent a card at Christmas sayin he’s sorry he couldn’t make it home<br>
    Mama had to borrow money from the neighbor just to make a supper from the butcher’s bone<br>
    That year we didn’t get no stockings—but the schools were closed on account of snow<br>
    I remember mama sitting us all down and sayin, “Presents ain’t always store-bought things you know—<br>
        It’s sometimes when you feel like cryin that you oughtta thank your lucky star<br>
        With this world bein the way it is—and these times bein what they are </p>
 
    <p>I come from Pennsylvania, a steel town they call Bethlehem<br>
    The stacks ain’t fired since ‘03—and now there’s casinos right on top of them<br>
    I’ve since lived in other places—a few of them have felt like home<br>
    But I never seem to stick round too long—there’s just too much of this damn world to roam<br>
        If there’s a place and y’all’re going, I’ll take the last seat in that car<br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times bein what they are</p>
 
    <p>As soon as I got out of high school, I went off to college and took on debt<br>
    In hindsight the diploma ain’t done much for me and the loans still aren’t paid off yet<br>
    Someday I’ll be retirement ready but Lord knows I won’t have a dime to show<br>
    Cause healthcare costs what retirement used to and social security’s goin the way of the buffalo—<br>
    Boom or bust or desperation—any I’d say would be right on par <br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times being what they are</p>
 
    <p>I met a girl way out of my own league, I knew it couldn’t ever last too long<br>
    It was the first time I ever fell in love with someone, it was the first and only time that I wasn’t wrong—<br>
    She said, ‘Sam, you know what your whole hang-up is? You’re about as broken as the worst I’ve seen<br>
    You pretend to be living on the up-and-up, but really you’re just living on the in-between<br>
        When she left she said, “You ought to thank me—it’s not everyone would let you keep those scars<br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times being what they are—" </p>
 
    <p>I went in person to the factory to inquire after one of them jobs<br>
    Foreman said they weren’t hiring—matter of fact, they were getting ready to lay some people off<br>
    So I turned and started walkin, half-way home I stopped to wet my beak<br>
    Bartender said I looked like I’d just stepped in from a years-long losing streak <br>
        He poured a beer, slid it to me, said “Your money’s no good at my bar— <br>
        With this world bein the way it is and these times being what they are—”</p>
 
    <p>TV says there’s been another mass shooting—the politicians have nothin to say<br>
    They act like they can’t do anything about it, but they keep taking contributions from the NRA<br>
    And the worse it gets the more I’m certain that calling for the police just ain’t right—<br>
    If the violence of the civilian world don’t kill you, police brutality always might<br>
    You can sit by and say it ain’t your problem, but one of these days you’re gonna be forced to spar<br>
        With this world being the way it is and these times being what they are—</p>
 
    <p>When most folks are in debt and struggling because 1% hold most of a nation’s wealth<br>
    And there’s still the mindset that drugs is criminal rather than a matter of public health<br>
    The prison cells are overflowing with folks whose crimes don’t begin to compare<br>
    to the double-dealing, power-abusing two-faced legislators who put them there<br>
        But nothing comes as too surprising, the absurd don’t even feel bizarre<br>
        With this world bein the way it is and these times bein what they are</p>
 
    <p>The forests are all catching fire, mother nature’s been keepin score<br>
    Pollution is just the air we’re breathin from San Francisco to the Jersey Shore<br>
    Planet Earth is on its last legs, it’s resources will all be used up soon<br>
    Instead of working to develop sustainable solutions, scientists are seein bout building colonies on the moon<br>
        I spose I should be singing – Ain’t we lucky to have got this far?<br>
        With this world bein the way it is and these times bein what they are    </p>

    <h2>Stack Lee Shelton's John B. Stetson Hat</h2>

    <p>It was late Christmas evening somewhere in missori</br>
    Billy lyons was shot by mean old stack-o-lee</br>
    Some say it was cause he owed that man a debt</br>
    But the rest of us know it was much simpler than that</p>
    
    <p>Just ask William Curtis, he was tendin bar that night</br>
    He knew exactly who had started the whole fight</br>
    He said, Bill came in smiling, gave old stack a friendly pat</br>
    Then the fool goes and tries on his John B. Stetson hat</p>
    
    <p>Why’d anybody go and do a crazy thing that?</br>		 
    As to try on stack lee shelton’s john B Stetson hat?</p> 
    
    <p>The newsman he came running when he heard about Bill’s death</br>
    he bursts in Willy’s bar room with his pencil, out of breath,</br>
    “When? Where? What happened?  How’d he do it? What for? Why?”</br>
    Stack Lee’s still sittin there with his smoking .45</p>
    
    <p>Stack says, “Go ask Deliah, she was sittin right there at the bar</br>
    Go and ask her, she can tell you everything she saw”</br>
    She says, “Well, Bill came in, said, ‘This seat taken?’ then he sat,</br>
    Then that fool tried on Stack Lee’s John B. Stetson hat.”</p>
    
    <p>Chorus</p>
    
    <p>well someone called the police and they all got there in good time</br>
    Stack Lee hadn’t moved one step from the scene of the crime</br>
    Commissioner walks straight up to Stack says, “You care to tell me who</br>
    That is lyin dead on the floor, whose blood’s all over you?”</p>
    
    <p>By the time Ms. Lyons gets there with her children all in tow</br>
    Its just in time to hear the commissioner say, “Well, boys, we’ve gotta let him go,</br>
    it’s a shame for billy lyons that stack lee Shelton shot him through</br>
    But if he’d a touched my john b Stetson, I’d’ve probably shot him, too.”</p>
    
    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>next day in the paper the story’s written plain to read</br>
    bout the death of billy lyons at the hand of stack-o-lee</br>
    the article concludes, calls the killin “justified”</br>
    says it isn’t very likely that Mr. Shelton will be tried</p> 
    
    <p>but he did stand trial eventually, so there wouldn’t be no doubt</br>
    it lasted all of fifteen minutes fore judge Hanson threw it out</br>
    when he heard that Billy Lyons took Stack’s hat from off his crown</br>
    he said, “This case is over,” and he brought his gavel down</p>

    <p>chorus</p>

    <p>They gave the orders in Washington, D.C., it was there the decision got made:</br>
    the US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, went and overturned Roe v. Wade</p>
    
    <p>now all you ladies better take warning, cause here's what the decision meant:</br> 
    that the female body is now officially the property of the US government</p>
    
    <p>they've left it open to interpretation, so it'll vary every place you go</br>
    but it's already illegal to get an abortion in Oklahoma and in Idaho</p>
    
    <p>Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Wisconsin--Arkansas and Missouri,</br> 
    South Dakota, Texas, ole West Virginia--Louisiana and don't forget Tennessee</p>
    
    <p>so if you get pregnant you'll have to deliver, no matter if by mistake</br>
    in the eyes of the state it don't make no difference if you consented or got gang raped</p>
    
    <p>it means one more physician will be off to the slammer for doing as his patient wished</br>
    it means one more anonymous Jane Doe baby for the annual adoption list</p>
    
    <p>or else it's one more body gone to the coroner with a note writ in the doctor's scrawl</br>
    here lies a patient whose cause of dying was: "No good reason at all."</p>
    
    <p>and all you who point to the scripture for evidence, and would count every death a sin</br>
    why don't you use your pro-life agenda to stop the next state-sanctioned execution?</p>
    
    <p>consider your preachers, your pastors, your prophets--your husbands who want you to forget--</br>
    That Jesus was born between God and a woman--man had nothing to do with it.</p>
    
    <p>The Republicans say that they favor America, and aim to make it Great Again!</br>
    They use familiar words like liberty and freedom, but spell em: 'F-A-S-C-I-S-M'</p>
    
    <p>and how can you say that you're standing for freedom, when it's freedom that you plainly refuse?</br>
    when you stand in support of the Supreme Court's decision to deny a woman's right to choose?</p>

    <p>A man named William Bezos took his gal to see a play</br>
    And on the journey homeward they stopped into a café</br>
    As soon as they were seated Liza grabbed the bill of fare</br>
    She looked the menu over, ordered everything was there</p>

    <p>Bill says, “I know you’re hungry gal, and I don’t like to squeal—</br>
    But who do you suppose is going to pay for such a meal?</br>
    You may have known me purty long, but you sure have got my first name wrong</br>
    My name is Bezos but it ain’t Jeffrey—</p>

    <p>My name is Bezos but it ain’t Jeffrey</br>
        There is no dot-com empire that belongs to me</br>
        You may have known me purty long but you sure have got my first name wrong</br>
        My name is Bezos but it ain’t Jeffery</p>

    <p>Bill Bezos married Liza thinking he could change her ways</br>
    But what she did to William’s purse I’m most ashamed to say</br>
    Whenever she’d go shopping she’d buy everything she’d see</br>
    And what she couldn’t pay for, had sent home, C.O.D.</p>

    <p>One day six big delivery wagons backed up to bill’s door</br>
    They asked him to accept the goods while they went back for more</br>
    It didn’t take bill very long to grab his hat and coat</br>
    When Liza came home that night, she found this little note:</p>

    <p>Well the east coast had me feelin like I had no room to grow</br>
    So I packed up everything I owned, came to Boise, Idaho</br>
    I’s lookin for a home—I’s lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Well as soon as I got to Boise, I got held up at the gate</br>
    Highway’s jammed with fancy cars with California plates</br>
    Lookin for a home—lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Next day I found me a lender and told him I hoped to buy</br>
    He laughed at my finances, said, “I guess you can try—”</br>
    Lookin for a home—lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Well the first house that we went to, we had to stand in line</br>
    By the time we made it to the door they were takin down the “For Sale” sign</br>
    That house got sold—that house got sold</p>

    <p>She took me to another one that I thought looked pretty nice</br>
    They asked for twice what it appraised for, it sold for double the askin-price</br>
    Looking for a home—still lookin for a home</p>

    <p>Well I finally put in an offer but it just weren’t no match</br>
    For that Seattle Do-Re-Mi and the San Fransisco cash</br>
    I get out-bid—I get out-bid</p>

    <p>Well the owners have it easy; all the buyers missed the boat</br>
    There’s people out here ready to slash each other’s throats—</br>
    Lookin for a home—looking for a home</p>

    <p>Now they say it’s a seller’s market, which means the seller can be bought</br>
    But not before he’s cleaned you out and taken all you got</br>
    You’re lookin for a home—you need a bigger loan!</p>

    <p>Well I wish someone had told me—I wished that I had known</br>
    I moved from Philadelphia to Boise just to live in Mountain Home</br>
    Mountain Home—that’ll be my home!</p>

    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#updatesReprises&Ripoffs_album">Back to Album</a></h4>

    <p>There is a man you’ll hear some about</br>
    never had much fortune or fame—</br>
    But he lived and died a hero to some</br>
    Dietrich Bonhoffer was his name</br>
    Dietrich Bonhoffer was his name</p>
    
    <p>Born and raised on German soil</br>
    At the turn of the century</br>
    He studied hard at the Berlin College</br>
    Got himself a theology degree</br>
    Got himself a theology degree</p>
    
    <p>He preached the gospel of the poor</br>
    To all them that wasn’t free</br>
    When Adolf Hitler came to power</br>
    He said, “Friends this ain’t how it should be—”</br>
    My friends, this ain’t how it should be</p> 
    
    <p>Bonhoffer joined the ranks of them</br>
    who spoke out against the Nazi scum</br>
    and even though he was a pacifist</br>
    he said, “About this Hitler, something must be done!”</br>
    About this Hitler, something must be done!”</p>
    
    <p>He was silenced on the radio</br>
    He was silenced in the lecture hall</br>
    The Nazis gave him a pretty hard time—</br>
    He couldn’t hardly get no work at all</br>
    Couldn’t hardly get no work at all</p>
    
    <p>When his anti-Nazi views got known</br>
    His friends begged him to come away</br>
    They told him, “It ain’t safe for none but Nazis over there,”</br>
    He said, “That’s why I’m a gonna stay— </br>
    That’s exactly why I’ve gotta stay”</p>
    
    <p>He joined a resistance movement underground</br>
    Where he got sworn to secrecy</br>
    They made a plot to take Hitler down</br>
    They called it operation valkerie</br>
    They called it operation valkerie</p>
    
    <p>They put a bomb in an old briefcase</br>
    and got it planted in a meeting room</br>
    when Hitler sat down with his generals to talk</br>
    that briefcase went ker-boom—!</br>
    that briefcase went kaboom—!</p>
    
    <p>The explosion killed a man or two</br>
    But the attempt to murder Hitler failed</br>
    when he found out who had put the briefcase there</br>
    They threw Bonhoffer in jail</br>
    The Nazis threw bonhoffer in a jail</p>
    
    <p>And there he sat for a year and a half</br>
    Writing letters and sermons to his Lord</br>
    All the while praying his endless prayer</br>
    To bring an ending to this awful war</br>
    To bring an ending to this awful war</p>
    
    <p>He wrote, “the question aint how can I escape this mess</br>
    and still keep my own conscience clean?</br>
    the question is how will life endure—</br>
    if we stand by and don’t do anything?</br>
    If we all stand by and don’t do anything?”</p>
    
    <p>The execution orders finally came down—</br>
    April 8 of 1945</br>
    The very next morning at dawn’s first light</br>
    They hung bonhoffer til he died</br>
    They hung dietrich bonhoffer til he died</p>
    
    <p>Some people say he could’ve made it out</br>
    If he had given up or surrendered or lied</br>
    And some say that all he ever did was fail—</br>
    But at least old bonhoffer tried</br>
    At least deitrich bonhoffer tried</p>
    
    <p>Wherever there’s evil men takin power</br>
    And people see it but just don’t care</br>
    Wherever there’s a country getting less free by the hour</br>
    the ghost of bonhoffer’s goin there</br>
    the ghost of bonhoffer’s goin there</p>

    Bout a new kind of virus, Corona’s the name</br>
    From China to Europe to the US of A—</br>
    This is what all of the people there say:</p>
        
    <p>So long, it’s been good to know ya</br>
        So long, it’s been good to know  ya</br>
        So long, it’s been good to know ya</br>
        This coronavirus has me sittin at home</br>
        Wishin I weren’t all alone </p>
    
    <p>to contain the disease the lawmakers implore</br> 
    no crowds shall consist of a hundred or more</br>
    they’re cancellin festivals, concerts, parades</br>
    as for weddings and funerals—they’ll just have to wait</p>

    <p>chorus</p> 
    
    <p>they’ve locked up the restaurants and they’re closing the stores</br>
    most places of businesses are shutting their doors</br>
    it’s stopped the economy dead in its tracks</br>
    if you can’t work from home, they’ll give you the axe—sayin</p>

    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>if you’re in education, they say you’ll be fine</br>
    colleges are movin everything to online</br>
    so you can still take your classes and do your workload</br>
    long as the internet servers don’t collapse or explode</p>
    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>the doctors will tell you to keep your hands clean</br>

    <p>With every new death, there’s an increase of sorrow</br> 
    5 gone today, will be 500 tomorrow</br>
    No telling how many we’ll lose fore the end</br>
    They say it’s not a matter of “if” but of “when”—</p>
    <p>chorus</p>
    
    <p>The CDC says they couldn’t rehearse</br>
    And before it gets better it’ll have to get worse</br>
    We saw the thing coming but we couldn’t prepare</br>
    So our advice to you now is to just say your prayers—</p>

    <p>now I’m sitting at home in my self-quarantine</br>
    doin my best to practice social distancing</br>

    <p>Went to prison cause I couldn’t pay a lousy fine</br>
    Put me away so long I lost track of the time—</br>
    January first it was ten below,</br>
    They set me loose without a place to go</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I tried the shelters, but they didn’t have any beds</br>
    So I asked if there were somewhere I could go instead?</br>
    They said if you need to keep warm and dry</br>
    Give the subway platform a try—</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I wanted work but I didn’t have a state ID</br>
    So I paid a little visit to the PA DMV</br>
    I took a number and I got in line</br>
    I’s still waiting at the closing time—</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>Next day I went back down there very first thing</br>
    They sent me away, said, When you come back be sure and bring:</br>
    Proof of address and proof of birth</br>
    And 30.50, and that’s all I’m worth </br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I also needed my social security card</br>
    Trine to get it without ID’s nothing short of hard</br>
    Try to get it and they’ll tell you, brother—</br>
    You need the one to get the other</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>If I land a job, the minimum is all it pays</br>
    All it promises is an annual fifty-cent raise</br>
    I’ll be working full plus overtime</br>
    Rent’s still late and I’ll still get fined</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I can’t keep track of the hours anymore</br>
    I’m at work sixteen of every twenty-four</br>
    Plain exhausted, can’t get no rest</br>
    Nough to make even a hopeful man depressed</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I’ve been living tween a hard place and a rock</br>
    My life’s just one long race against the clock</br>
    Soon as I can get a little bit of slack</br>
    Take one step forward and two steps back</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>Everywhere you turn folks is struggling to get by</br>
    the only way to get enough is to fight or die—</br>
    You wanna know where all the money went</br>
    check the pockets of the one percent</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>Donald Trump has shut the government down</br>
    And empty is the head that wears the crown</br>
    Now my foodstamps won’t come in</br>
    Til the government’s up and running again—</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I’m sick as a dog, but I still ain’t insured</br>
    Poverty’s an illness and I don’t know if I can be cured</br>
    Every time that I get tripped up</br>
    There ain’t nobody there to help me up</br>
        Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I needed money and I needed money fast</br>
    I had debts to pay and my deadlines all were past</br>
    I’d be alright but for one big flaw:</br>
    I can’t make a dollar short of breaking the law</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>
    
        <p>I’ve heard the tales that Jesus Christ was poor</br>
    He lived hand-to-mouth while goin door-to-door	</br>
    How come every door I try and knock</br>
    Leads me right back around to the cops?</br>
        Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</p>

    <h2>Talkin Wall-Building Blues</h2>
    <h4>Album: <i>Updates, Reprises & Ripoffs, 2024</i> Track 10</h4>
    <h4><a class="link_format" href="music.html#updatesReprises&Ripoffs_album">Back to Album</a></h4>

    <p>I was feeling sad and small and scared</br>
    a National Emergency had been declared</br>
    took a dose of Fox News for my breakfast</br>
    headed down to southern texas</br>
        aiming to defend my country—</br>
    against the impending immigrant threat!</p>

    <p>Well I got down there expecting to meet my enemy</br>
    But there’s just desert far as the eye could see</br>
    then I felt a gunbarrel poking at my spine</br>
    I turned around saw it was a man with skin like mine</br>
        He said, “Darn!  I thought you was one of them! </br>
    Damn if I didn’t just about shoot you dead!”</p>
    
    <p>Well he laughs it off and turns me loose</br>
    When a parade of people comes marching through</br>
    Looked like a band of redneck soldiers</br>
    Had picks and trowels flung over their shoulders</br>
        I said is it them? </br>
    The immigrant threat?</p> 

    <p>The fella says, “No—that ain’t them at all—</br>
    They’re friends—come to help build Trump’s wall!”</br>
    I asked him what he was talkin about</br>
    Said, “It’s Trump’s plan to keep the immigrants out</br>
        Build a wall—</br>
        You know, like a big one!</p>

        <p>He says, “I was born in the good old USA</br>
    That’s more than them immigrants can say</br>
    Even though my ancestors came on a boat</br>
    And robbed and pillaged the native folks</br>
        And enslaved the Africans—</br>
        We still been here long enough to know it’s ours!</p>

        <p>Says “we’ll build a wall that’s thick and strong</br>
    It’ll be half a million miles long</br>
    Like the Great Wall of China or of old Berlin</br>
    It’ll keep foreigners out and us safe within</br>
        Kind of like a prison—but for our freedom!</br>
        And all the stories we tell ourselves!</p>

        <p>I’s beginning to see what kind of plan it was</br>
    But he went on, “We need a wall like this because</br>
    These invaders are coming onto our private land</br>
    They’re smuggling drugs and people and contraband—</br>
        They’re takin our jobs!—</br>
    bunch a criminals!”</p>

    <p>Well we walked up a hill and peeped the horizon</br>
    saw a crowd of people there building something</br>
    he said “some day barbed wire, brick and mortar</br>
    is all there’ll be at the US-Mexico border”</br>
        I could feel the fake news starting to wear off</br>
        And a new nightmare beginning</p>

        <p>We came to a pen made of chainlink fence</br>
    Inside was a hundred or so immigrants</br>
    Most of them was kids, emaciated</br>
    They’d been took from their parents, incarcerated</br> 
        Maybe orphaned, too</br>
        No tellin</p>

        <p>I asked one of em why he decided to come across</br>
    He shook his head, sighed and coughed</br>
    Said, before I answer let me ask you one</br>
    If it was leave or die, which would you have done?</br>
        I said I guess I’d leave</br>
        He didn’t look at me after that</p>

        <p>Just when I thought it couldn’t get any sadder</br>
    My tour guide pulls out a big old ladder</br>
    we climbed, looked out, and all I seed</br>
    was a cactus plant and a tumbleweed</br>
        where’s that immigrant threat I was hearing so much about?</br>
        national emergency my eye!</p>		

        <p>Trump doesn’t want foreigners comin across</br>
    And a few billion tax-dollars is all it’ll cost</br>
    when the proposal to congress finally went around</br>
    they wouldn’t budge so he shut it down</br>
    talk about stealing work</br>
        From hard-working Americans</p>

    <p>You go far enough back on that family tree</br>
    You’ll find Trump had ancestors over in Germany</br>
    They came and settled in the American nation</br>
    in a process that’s known as—what?—immigration</br>
    hung around for the revolution</br>
    helped establish the American hypocrisy</p>

    <p>Humpdy Trumpty can sit on his wall</br>
    The higher he builds it, the harder the fall</br>
    All the kings horses and all the kings men</br>
    won’t be electing him again</br>
        they’ll know better</br>
        least I hope they will…</p>
